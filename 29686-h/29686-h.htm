<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>
<h3>A PERILOUS PASSAGE</h3>

<p>"Well, good-bye, boys! You won't go
far from camp before we return, will
you?" The speaker was one of two men seated
in an Indian canoe. He gripped the forward
paddle, while his companion at the stern added
cheerfully&mdash;</p>

<p>"The backwoods is not the City of London.
There are no policemen to appeal to if you lose
your way. Besides, we hope to find dinner waiting
for our return. Hunting lost sons is not the
same sport as hunting moose."</p>

<p>Both the boys laughed at the elder man's remark,
and one&mdash;Bob Arnold by name&mdash;answered&mdash;</p>

<p>"Don't worry about us, father. Alf and I
can take care of ourselves for half a day. Can't
we, Alf?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span></p>

<p>"Rather," the younger chum replied. "It's
our respected parents who'll need to take care
of themselves in unknown waters in that cockleshell."
Then he called out merrily, imitating the
tone of the first speaker&mdash;his father: "Take
care of yourselves, dads! Remember the Athabasca
River is not Regent Street!"</p>

<p>"Cheeky youngster!" returned the elder man
banteringly, as he struck the forward paddle into
the water. "There's not much of the invalid
left about you after three months' camping."</p>

<p>Then with waving hands and pleasant chaffing,
that showed what real good chums the quartette
were, the men struck out for the centre of the
river, leaving their sons watching from the strand
before the camp that was pitched beneath the
shadow of the great pine trees.</p>

<p>It was a glorious morning&mdash;just the right sort
for a hunting-expedition. The air was just chilly
enough to render paddling a welcome exercise,
and just warm enough to allow intervals of
pleasant drifting in the centre of the current
when there were no shoals or driftwood to be
avoided.</p>

<p>"Yes," remarked Holden, the younger of the
two men, as the rhythm of the dripping paddles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
murmured pleasantly with Nature's music heard
from leafy bough and bush; "yes, Alf's a
different boy now. Who would have believed
that these three short months would have changed
a fever-wasted body into such a sturdy frame?"</p>

<p>"It looks like a miracle," returned the other
man. "It was a great idea, that of a six months'
trapping in the backwoods. When we get back
to England we'll all four look as healthy as
savages. My Bob is the colour of a redskin."</p>

<p>"It was a great blessing that you were able to
bring him. It wouldn't have been half as enjoyable
for Alf, not having a chum."</p>

<p>The elder man laughed softly as he turned a
look of good-comradeship towards his companion.</p>

<p>"That's just as it ought to be, Holden," he
said. "You and I were chums at school, chums
at college, and now chums in business. It's the
right thing that our sons should follow our good
example. At least, that's my opinion."</p>

<p>"And you know it's mine," was the response.
"But, I say! Do you think we are wise to keep
quite in the centre of the current? It seems to
be driving pretty hard, and we don't know the
course. We might wish to land if we saw rapids."</p>

<p>"I dare say you are right," replied Arnold.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
"We'll steer straight across that bend ahead of
us. After that we can keep well under the
shadow of the willows&mdash;or near them. We will
look for a good landing spot and strike inwards.
There ought to be moose or some equally good
sport among those bluffs and clearings."</p>

<p>It is one thing to make plans; it is quite
another matter to carry them out. Especially
is this the case when strangers are travelling in
strange country.</p>

<p>Of course the present mode of travel was no
novelty to either of the men. Their youth had
been passed in Western Canada (though not in
the vicinity of the present voyage) before their
parents sent them home to college in England.
But even the hardened voyager knows that
experience does not anticipate all chances, and
this case was no exception to the rule.</p>

<p>The river was certainly beginning to run at a
pace that was perceptibly swifter than that of the
start when two miles farther up. This did not
give any cause for concern, however, for the ears
of the travellers were prepared for any sound
that indicated rapids, and there was no other
contingency that they felt need to dread.</p>

<p>At a little distance ahead, the course could be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
seen to take a sharp turn to the right, where
the dense growth of beech and towering pines
resembled the portals of a giant gateway; and,
as it neared the opening, the canoe swung round
the curve with the swift flight of a swallow.</p>

<p>It was a sudden change of pace, due mainly to
the sharpness of the turn. But as soon as the
men fully entered the fresh span of the course
they both started involuntarily, for the banks
were so steep as to prohibit landing, and the
river narrowed towards a second gateway formed
by towering cliffs&mdash;steep as a Colorado cañon.</p>

<p>"Look out!" exclaimed Holden, as he knelt
high and gripped his paddle firmly. "Leave the
steering to me, I can manage better from the
stern. Come back here if you can."</p>

<p>The canoe had already begun to dance among
foaming crests like an egg-shell.</p>

<p>Arnold crept towards his companion.</p>

<p>"Not a pleasant look out!" he remarked, with
a grim smile on his face. "It will be a marvel
if we get through that cañon with dry skins."</p>

<p>"Dry skins!" laughed Holden. His voice
was laughing, but his eyes were fixed steadily a
few yards in front of the canoe with that firm
gaze of a brave man looking peril straight in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
face. "Dry skins! It'll be a greater marvel if
we get through it with any skins at all!"</p>

<p>"We'll have a good try, anyway," responded
Arnold. Then he remarked quaintly: "This is
like old times, isn't it&mdash;you and I out in a scrape
together? I hope the Head won't blow us up
for it when we get back to school!"</p>

<p>The river had now entered the narrow course,
and was rushing on a foaming way with an awesome
roar.</p>

<p>Now and then the canoe would leap to one side
as a wave hungrily licked her prow; sometimes
she would push her nose into a crest that splashed
the travellers with spray. Fortunately the spring
torrents were over, and danger from drifting logs
was not to be reckoned with, but the possibility
that rocks might be hidden among the white
waves was a reasonable cause for concern&mdash;all
the more so, considering that they were
unknown.</p>

<p>Onwards they dashed at breakneck speed,
while both the men sat grimly silent, prepared to
take bravely whatever fate might be in store for
them. Probably their thoughts were more of
the two boys at the camp than of their present
strait&mdash;more engaged with commending their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
sons to the care of God than speculating as to
the result of this adventure.</p>

<p>Then, with a suddenness that gave no time for
thought, there was a crash like crackling match-wood&mdash;a
rush of water that seemed to crush all
within its embrace. Next moment the two men
were struggling in the stream.</p>

<p>At that crisis, Arnold's first thought was for
his friend&mdash;just as it had always been since he
fought his chum's first battles at school.</p>

<p>He grabbed wildly, and held on to something
that he afterwards found to be his friend's jacket.</p>

<p>"Are you all right?" he yelled above the din
of the waters, as both men reached the surface.</p>

<p>"A1 at Lloyd's!" came the cheerful reply&mdash;undaunted
even in extremity.</p>

<p>"That's good. We'll weather this yet. Hang
on to my coat, and we'll keep together!"</p>

<p>Being expert swimmers, there was little cause
for fear so long as the current passed clear of
obstacles, and the men had little to do but keep
a suitable position, for the force of the water bore
them well on the surface. But the chief danger
was from undercurrents and whirlpools, and as
the boundaries of the river rapidly narrowed this
risk became more serious every moment.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span></p>

<p>As they rushed onwards, so the two walls of
the cañon came nearer&mdash;shutting out the light
until the scene resembled the gloomy depths of
a seething cauldron.</p>

<p>Closer and closer came the walls; swifter and
swifter rushed the water.</p>

<p>Now the limits were so narrow that the river
was but a smooth riband darting between walls
worn glassy by the wear of countless ages.</p>

<p>The friends came so close that they touched
one another's shoulders.</p>

<p>That was one moment.</p>

<p>The next instant each felt himself shot forward
through a narrow opening like a cork that is
volleyed from a bottle; and when the men came
to realise their position, they found themselves
floating on the surface of a placid lake into which
the cañon poured its flood.</p>

<p>They looked at one another. The adventure
had parted them, but Arnold laughingly held up
a portion of Holden's coat as a banner to signal
his position.</p>

<p>"Our same old luck!" exclaimed Holden,
laughing.</p>

<p>"It'll cost you a new coat!" returned Arnold
with equal cheer.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span></p>

<p>It was perhaps a hundred yards to the nearest
shore, so the men immediately started in that
direction. Both were considerably exhausted
by the experiences through which they had
providentially passed without serious injury, and
consequently the progress was slow.</p>

<p>But at last they reached the bank, where the
red and grey willows bent their long strands in
a tangled trellis.</p>

<p>Knee deep in the mud, the men stood upright,
to clear the way to freedom. But, as they parted
the nearest branches, a number of arms were
suddenly forced through the scrub; a number of
hands gripped them with irresistible strength;
and before they could realise what had happened
they were rudely dragged up the bank of the lake.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>
<h3>DEER-STALKING</h3>


<p>The boys did not find that time hung heavily
on their hands when left to their own
devices.</p>

<p>The two tents that marked the camp at Crane
Creek were pitched on a grassy slope that led
down to the Athabasca's dancing waters. This
had been their camp-ground for several days
after a desultory hunting pilgrimage from Loon
Portage&mdash;the last town where they had left railways
and civilisation. Having penetrated northwards
into a region that was apparently remote
from attacks of the plough and beyond the sound
of the rancher's whoop, it was determined to make
this a headquarters for a couple of months or so.
Sport in much variety had already been found.
Moose-tracks had been seen in the vicinity, and
it had been with the hope of practically substantiating
the discovery that the two elders had
started off that morning.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span></p>

<p>The boys' first consideration was that of dinner.</p>

<p>"Let's go into the woods and see what we can
find!" Bob Arnold suggested to his chum, after
they had watched the canoe disappear round a
bend of the river. "There's only the carcase of
a prairie chicken left in the larder. That won't
be much to satisfy our paters when they come
back."</p>

<p>"And we'll want to tackle a small morsel ourselves,"
added Holden. "I've never had such an
appetite in my life until I came West. There's
something inside me that is always calling out:
'Grub! Grub! Give me grub!'" And the boy
sniffed the pine-scented air with relish, as a hungry
street gamin sniffs the fragrance of a cook-shop.</p>

<p>Bob laughed as he strolled back to the tents
and stuck a tin dipper into a wooden pail near by
for a draught of cold water that had lately been
taken from a moss-bordered spring.</p>

<p>"You're a freak of Nature; that's what you
are, Alf. Two months ago you were as thin and
white as a sheet of paper, and even Saturday's
school resurrection-pie failed to tempt you. Now
you are the colour of a redskin, and nothing is
safe from your teeth!"</p>

<p>"I'll not deny that I'm sometimes a bit peckish,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
returned the younger boy, entering one of the
tents and filling a cartridge belt, which he
proceeded to buckle round his waist. Then he
remarked with twinkling eyes: "Say! Mustn't
the fellows at St. Wenford's be green with envy
if they think of themselves swotting away in class
while we're having the time of our lives in the
backwoods? They'll all be back by this time,
for the school was only to be closed for seven
weeks, the doctor said. Lucky thing fever is&mdash;in
some ways."</p>

<p>"In some ways&mdash;perhaps," repeated Bob in an
undertone that had much seriousness in it, as he
followed his friend's example in preparing for the
hunt. "But it didn't seem very lucky&mdash;to me&mdash;when&mdash;when
your dad was sent for, post-haste,
that night. It didn't seem the best of luck then&mdash;to
me, I mean."</p>

<p>"Nor to me," added Alf with equal seriousness.
Both boys sighed at the memory, and then the
younger resumed light-heartedly: "I tell you
what it was, Bob, I was thoroughly riled with
that fever. We always meant to be chums for
the rest of our lives, just like our dads; and it
put my back up to find the fever trying to upset
our plans. That's what did it. Once I got the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
spirit of fight into me, I knocked the stuffing out
of the old fever!"</p>

<p>"That you did!" laughed Arnold. "The
doctors said they never saw anything like your
recovery, once you set to work. Well, I'm fixed
up for shooting. Are you all right? Better
take hunting-knives. They come in handy."</p>

<p>"And a repeating rifle, in case of big game.
One will be enough; we can take turns in
carrying it."</p>

<p>"All aboard. I'll just see that the camp-fire
is properly stamped out, and then we'll set off."</p>

<p>In a short time all preparations were completed,
and the two boys were ready to enjoy a morning's
adventure in any form that it chose to offer.</p>

<p>Having hopes that something bigger than
duck or chicken might reward their efforts, the
chums immediately struck inwards through the
bush, following an old trail from a buffalo wallow
that was the ancient path of those bovines when
they sought water to drink or mud to wallow in
when the mosquitoes were troublesome.</p>

<p>Beyond chipmunks, gophers, and a single
jack-rabbit (the latter falling to Bob's gun),
nothing was met to tempt powder for some time.
Then they reached a large "slough" that in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
early spring would be a small lake, though now
it was filled with long blue grass and wild
lavender. Here the boys paused as they examined
the clearing.</p>

<p>"It's a likely-looking place for rattlesnakes,"
Bob remarked. "It hardly seems probable
that&mdash;&mdash; What's that?&mdash;Over there in the centre?"
The speaker's voice had suddenly dropped to an
excited undertone as he pointed to a couple of
small dark marks that peeped above long grass
and might have been the ends of a broken
branch.</p>

<p>Alf stared keenly for a few moments.</p>

<p>"I thought I saw them move&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"So did I. Wait a minute and we'll make
sure."</p>

<p>Keeping as still as statues, the boys waited
in silence with both pairs of eyes steadily fixed
upon the dark objects, and the pulses of each
gave a sudden jump, for then the points moved
and sank among the long grass.</p>

<p>"Antelope! Those are horns!" decided Alf,
to which Bob returned, with a sly dig at his
chum's ribs&mdash;</p>

<p>"'Horns?' <i>Antlers</i>, you old duffer! We're
not hunting cows!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span></p>

<p>"Same thing," was the retort. "Horns or
antlers both mean deer in these parts." Next
the boy gave a slight start. "Say! I thought
I heard the branches moving above my head!"</p>

<p>The young hunters turned to look upwards
among the dense leaves of a gigantic maple tree
whose lower branches were matted with twining
convolvulus and other wild creepers.</p>

<p>"A bird or a chipmunk," was Bob's decision.
"In any case, whatever it is, this antelope
comes first. We are both at windward, though I
guess he hasn't scented us yet on account of the
long grass. But I think it would be better if we
got round to the lee-side and waited for him to
rise."</p>

<p>"How would it be if I were to stay here, in
case he comes this way?" Alf suggested. "You
could take the rifle&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"A good idea. No, you keep the rifle,"
amended Bob, falling in with the suggestion. "If
I get to lee, I'll be near enough to do damage
with the breech-loader. If I fail, you'll have the
longer sight with the rifle."</p>

<p>"All right," said Holden. "I'll wait just where
I am behind this red willow. I'll not fire until
I'm certain that your gun is out of it."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span></p>

<p>"Good. I'm off," responded Bob, and immediately
he started a cautious creeping journey
in the shelter of the bush, in hopes of reaching
the lee-side of the slough without attracting the
attention of the animal that was apparently resting
in innocent bliss among the cool blue grass.</p>

<p>During his silent guard Alf a second time
thought that he heard a rustling above his head.
But, following former experience, he thought
that the sound was due to nothing more than a
flying squirrel at the most, and he did not allow
his eyes to be diverted from the spot where the
signs of the antelope had last been seen.</p>

<p>By and by he at last caught sight of his chum.
Bob had reached the farther end of the oval
slough, and had risen to show himself. He
waved his arm to announce his position before
creeping down to the grass. Holden answered
the signal, and rose to be ready for emergencies.
But, as he moved his right foot, he stepped upon
something soft, whereupon he was startled by a
cry like that of a kitten. He gave a swift glance
downwards, and saw that he had inadvertently
trodden on something small and furry which was
now expressing pain by means of shrill infantile
wails.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span></p>

<p>But his attention was immediately diverted by
the sight of a dark body starting up from the
long grass in the slough. At the same instant
he heard the sharp crack of Arnold's gun. Alf
darted the butt of his rifle to his shoulder, to be
in readiness for an emergency shot; but, before
the position was attained, something launched
down upon him from the trees&mdash;bearing him
forwards into the willow bush, while the forest
echoed with the snarls of an infuriated wild
beast.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>
<h3>THE LONELY CAMP</h3>

<p>A lynx may be only a cat, but a cat that is
the size of a young tiger, with all a tiger's
ferocity, is no pleasant opponent at any time.
Add to naturally aggressive tendencies the fact
that her baby has cried out in pain, and you have
an angry mother-fiend that takes a deal of seeking
to find her equal in fierceness.</p>

<p>In this case the lynx had been watching the
young hunters with one eye for some time from
her shelter among the leaves of the overhanging
maple. She had been keeping the other eye
upon her offspring, having an idea that the
humans might endanger its safety; and, when
she heard the cry of pain, she simply dropped
from her branch right upon Holden's back, fixing
her claws in his coat and snapping furiously at
his neck.</p>

<p>Luckily the boy's hunting-coat was of tough<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
buckskin, and when the lynx set her teeth in
the collar she imagined that she was wreaking
vengeance upon flesh and blood. And the sound
she made was enough to chill the marrow.</p>

<p>Arnold had heard the scream and his chum's
cry of surprise at the sudden assault. But he did
not understand it at first. He surmised vaguely
that it was nothing more than sympathetic
rejoicing at his successful shot that had toppled
a fine buck antelope in the grass.</p>

<p>However, second thoughts quickly dispelled
the first surmise, for he heard Holden calling
upon him in evident trouble.</p>

<p>"Bob! Come quickly! There's something
on my back, and I can't get at it!"</p>

<p>Bob dashed into the long grass as the shortest
route. But before he had crossed the slough
Alf had managed to free himself from one sleeve
of his coat, and had got the lynx beneath him.</p>

<p>Now it was a hand-to-hand fight. The claws
of the animal seemed to be everywhere. They
struck with lightning swiftness, and the teeth
snapped like steel gins. In fact, the boy's
opponent was simply a mass of fur and claws&mdash;nothing
that could be gripped, but everything
that could wound.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span></p>

<p>"Don't shoot!" exclaimed Alf, as his friend
appeared with gun half raised in his hands.
"You can't get a clean shot at her&mdash;ugh! the
brute! She's clawed my shoulder!"</p>

<p>It was a fierce struggle while it lasted.</p>

<p>Hot and panting, Alf fought to get a grip of
the creature's throat. She, on her part, seemed
to divine his purpose, and battled successfully to
prevent him.</p>

<p>The combatants rolled over. The lynx was
uppermost, and she made a vicious snap at the
boy's face. But the quick head-turn of a trained
boxer avoided that snap, and the sharp white
teeth met in the lad's coat collar, slightly grazing
his neck.</p>

<p>Alf gave a cry of pain.</p>

<p>That was too much for Bob, who snatched his
hunting-knife from its sheath, and threw himself
upon the enemy.</p>

<p>One plunge of the blade in the animal's side
made it yell like a thing possessed. Then Bob
dug his thumbs into the lynx's neck and pressed
his fingers into its throat, pulling towards him
with all his might, to drag the animal from his
friend.</p>

<p>The knife was still sticking in the wound, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
as the lynx felt another enemy above her, she
momentarily turned her attention to the one
above, while she struck with her claws to deliver
herself from the fingers that were choking her.</p>

<p>That was Alf's chance. He plucked at the
hunting-knife, and plunged it into the wild animal
with three rapid thrusts.</p>

<p>Then followed another scream more wild and
blood-curdling than the rest. It was a death-cry;
for in a moment more Bob stood up, holding a
limp body by the neck.</p>

<p>Holden slowly rose from his bed of broken
willows, and he grinned as he regarded his clothes&mdash;especially
the jacket, that hung from his left
arm like the evening dress of a Weary Willie.</p>

<p>"Rather the worse for wear and tear!" he
remarked with comical ruefulness.</p>

<p>"Which? The clothes or yourself?" questioned
Bob, as he threw the lynx's carcase to one
side.</p>

<p>"I guess it's the clothes more than anything
else. There's a lot of blood about, but that's
the lynx's more than mine."</p>

<p>In truth the lad was a strange spectacle, for
hardly an inch of his clothes had not been visited
by claws or teeth. The boy himself was covered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
with dust and dirt, while crimson patches of blood
completed a picture that was both humorous and
pathetic.</p>

<p>Fortunately, both the boys were able to look
at the matter from the former point of view.
Physical damage was not severe. There was a
scratch on Alf's shoulder. Arnold examined it
carefully, but decided that no danger was likely
to follow, since the claws had passed through the
leather jacket before touching the flesh. As a
precaution against blood-poisoning, he insisted
upon sucking the wound, after which he bound it
with a handkerchief.</p>

<p>"That will be all right, I expect," he said, as
the operation was completed. "I don't think we
need worry about the other scratches."</p>

<p>"There would have been more&mdash;worse ones,
probably&mdash;if you hadn't turned up," said Alf. "I
couldn't get at the beast any way. She seemed
to have claws like a porcupine's quills."</p>

<p>"And she knew jolly well how to use them.
Do you think she's worth skinning?"</p>

<p>The dead lynx was examined.</p>

<p>"I don't think the hide is worth the trouble,"
commented Holden. "It's a bit ragged in any
case, and the hunting-knife did not improve it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
But I'll take the tail as a memento. What about
the antelope?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I got him all right. He's lying somewhere
in the grass."</p>

<p>"Good!" exclaimed Alf delightedly. He
had soon recovered from the exhaustion of the
fight. "That will surprise the paters when they
return to grub. And say! I'm as hungry as a
hawk. Let's get back to camp. It must be
getting on for noon by this time."</p>

<p>"Half-past ten. That's all," remarked Bob, as
he looked at his watch. "Time drags when the
appetite's healthy. I vote we leave the antelope
where it is for the present, and shoot a few
chicken for dinner. It would be a pity for us to
try skinning the animal. We might spoil it altogether.
I dare say father will do it for us afterwards."</p>

<p>"What about wolves?" questioned Alf.</p>

<p>"Yes, I hadn't thought of them. But I don't
think there's much chance of wolves coming
in the daytime. It would be safe enough until
night."</p>

<p>"Right you are," agreed Alf. "First for the
tail of my lynx, and then a bee-line for the camp."</p>

<p>Retracing their path by the buffalo trail, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
boys were soon on the home journey again.
Five prairie chicken were bagged on the way,
and soon the hunters were once more at the
camp-ground.</p>

<p>Of course Holden's first move was to strip,
plunge into the river, and then robe himself in
garments that were less like a rag-picker's bundle.
Meantime, Arnold set to work lighting a fire and
preparing the chicken for roasting on wooden
spits, as their camping experience had taught
them.</p>

<p>By midday the meal was in readiness. The
birds were cooked, "biscuits" were baked in the
camp-oven, the fragrant smell of coffee was issuing
from a billy-tin, and all preparations completed to
welcome the elder hunters.</p>

<p>But time went past, and there was no sign of
a canoe on the river.</p>

<p>"I wonder if they have missed their way?"
remarked Alf, to whom the waiting was a trial,
considering inside calls and tempting odours.</p>

<p>"I don't think that's likely," said Bob. "Your
dad and mine are both old backwoodsmen. I'm
beginning to think something has happened&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"An accident?"</p>

<p>"Possibly. But of course we can't tell. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
it isn't like them to be late when they promised
to be back by noon."</p>

<p>"But then, if an accident has happened to one,
the other could always come back and let us
know," Alf answered; and his chum returned&mdash;</p>

<p>"That's just what I've been thinking. I don't
want to frighten you, old man, but I can't help
thinking that something has gone wrong with
both."</p>

<p>"Perhaps it's the canoe. It might have got
damaged. They were exploring new water, you
know."</p>

<p>Bob nodded.</p>

<p>"As likely as not. In that case they'll come
back by land, and that would take some time, as,
of course, they would go much quicker by water.
We'll wait a little longer, and if they don't arrive
we'd better have our grub. They'll turn up later."</p>

<p>The boys waited as patiently as possible, but
ultimately, with no sign of the travellers, they
were obliged to dine alone; though the meal was
not eaten with customary cheerfulness, for both
the boys shared forebodings of troubles to come.</p>

<p>The day wore on, and still no signs of the
wanderers, while the anxiety of the boys rapidly
increased. And when night came, without bringing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
any news to allay concern, they then began
to decide that some serious accident must have
taken place.</p>

<p>Until late into the hours of darkness the two
lads sat by the camp-fire, starting hopefully at
each sound from the forest or river&mdash;ready to
believe that any whisper of Nature must be the
sound of a reassuring messenger.</p>

<p>How different it was from their usual little
camp-fire gatherings! At such times they were
wont to loll about while reciting the many incidents
of the day just gone, and planning fresh
exploits for the morrow. Even last night they
had thus sat and planned the expedition that had
ended in adding a heavier gloom to the night.</p>

<p>The fire-flies flickered their tiny lamps, the
night-hawks shrieked as they swooped from the
heavens, the owls hooted their dismal cries, and
the wolves wailed in the distance as they fought
over the remains of the antelope that had been
left to them.</p>

<p>It must have been near midnight when Bob
broke an unusually long spell of silence.</p>

<p>"Well, old boy," he said, with forced brightness,
"I guess the best thing we can do is to turn in.
They won't be back to-night, that's certain."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yet&mdash;one might come. I wouldn't like to be
asleep if&mdash;if there was any call, you know."</p>

<p>"Then we'll take it turn about&mdash;two hours
asleep, two hours watch," was the elder boy's
practical suggestion. "Besides, very likely we
are worrying ourselves without need. Anything
may have happened to keep them from returning&mdash;not
even an accident, as we've been
supposing. One never knows what may take
place in the backwoods, and&mdash;and perhaps they
were forced to wait till morning."</p>

<p>Bob knew, and Alf knew as well, that it was
but a plucky attempt to look at fears in the best
light&mdash;an effort to convince both against their
conviction that their evil forebodings were
groundless.</p>

<p>But Alf was not easily convinced.</p>

<p>"I am sure that nothing except accident could
have happened to prevent at least your father or
mine from returning to camp. They would know
that we should be worried. And no matter how
far they went by canoe in the morning, there has
been plenty of time to walk the distance. I can't
help thinking that they came upon tracks of the
moose, as they wanted, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hush," interrupted Bob kindly. "Don't let<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
your imagination run away with you like that,
old man. Besides, you know what good shots
both our fathers are. They know the ways of
most big game. No; I can't think that you are
right. Such an accident <i>might</i> happen to one&mdash;even
the finest trapper; but, to both&mdash;believe
me, it's out of the question. Now, turn in like a
good chap. I'll take first watch."</p>

<p>"You'll wake me as soon as the two hours are
up?" pressed Alf, reluctant to leave the watch
when he might have first sign of news.</p>

<p>"Yes, I'll waken you. Don't worry about that.
You are tired as a dog as it is&mdash;what with fighting
lynxes and other excitements. In two hours
you'll find that I'll be too ready for sleep to let
you doze a second over time."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>
<h3>FRIENDS OR FOES?</h3>

<p>So sudden had been the attack when the two
men were snatched from the waters of
the treacherous Athabasca, that they were too
confused to realise what was taking place. No
signs of any prowlers had been previously
evident, though possibly the fact that danger
from that quarter was unconsidered might have
secluded what would have been discernible by
suspicious eyes.</p>

<p>Moreover, the men were so exhausted by the
adventures through which they had just passed
that they were only able to offer feeble resistance,
and, by the time their scattered faculties were
collected, they found themselves lying bound in
the centre of a chattering throng of Indians.</p>

<p>Such conduct was certainly surprising in these
days, when the redmen are a peaceable people
who have learned to regard the pale-faces as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
well-meaning friends, and have long since buried
the hatchet of tribal feuds.</p>

<p>"What on earth can be the meaning of this?"
Arnold questioned of his companion, who lay at
his side.</p>

<p>"It's certainly extraordinary," the other man
said. "Yet they don't seem particularly aggressive."</p>

<p>"No. They offered no indignities, such as
would have been our fortune in olden days. But
did you notice how that old warrior examined the
knots himself? He seems to be a sort of head-man.
I can remember a smattering of a few
dialects, and I am sure I heard him say to the
braves: 'Not too tight. Do not hurt the pale-faces,
but keep them firm.'"</p>

<p>"It's certainly mysterious," said Holden.
"Perhaps we have arrived in the middle of some
sacred feast. Or perhaps we've come upon them
when they were about to carry out some form of
lawlessness."</p>

<p>Arnold shook his head decidedly.</p>

<p>"No. There are no signs of feasts. As for
the latter, these are Dacotahs&mdash;one of the most
law-abiding tribes. We'll have to look further
than that for an explanation. Of this I am<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
certain: we are in no immediate danger. That
they are chattering about us is evident from
these side-glances; but there is nothing hostile
in the looks."</p>

<p>"More like awe than hostility."</p>

<p>"Just what I was thinking. But see! That
old warrior is coming our way again. We'll
learn something this time, perhaps."</p>

<p>As Arnold spoke, an old Indian was seen to
step from the chattering crowd. He was tall,
well built, and still a fine specimen of manhood,
though his face bore traces of many
years.</p>

<p>That he received the homage due to rank as
well as to years was made plain by the respectful
way that a path was cleared, so that he might
pass through the group of twenty or thirty
redskins. He carried himself with the air of one
who commands respect as his right.</p>

<p>All the same, though there was no hesitation
in the steady stride with which the Indian
approached the captives, nor in the stern set of
his face, there was something in his eyes that
indicated awe in the heart. The other Indians
barely attempted to conceal their feelings.
Throughout there was the expression that seemed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
to say (to put it in plain English): "Plucky
of you, old chap. But better you than me!"</p>

<p>Reaching the Englishmen, who were bound
hands and legs, so that they were unable to adopt
any position unaided except sitting or lying
down, the old warrior stopped at a couple of
yards' distance.</p>

<p>Drawing his blanket tightly round his figure,
he folded his arms and thus addressed the
strangers in excellent English&mdash;</p>

<p>"The tomahawk has been buried between the
pale-faces and the redman for countless suns, and
for many suns their hands have met as the hands
of brothers. And the heart of Swift Arrow is
sore within him this day, for the hands of the
Dacotahs have been raised in their might against
those whose faces shine as those of our pale-face
brothers."</p>

<p>The old man paused, and Arnold jerked in&mdash;</p>

<p>"Then why on earth raise them? We did not
bid you truss us up with these rawhide thongs?"</p>

<p>The Indian shook his head.</p>

<p>"The ears of Swift Arrow are old. They
understand not as when he was a brave."</p>

<p>"Your idiom is too much for him, old man,"
said Holden quietly. "Try him with something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
easier. Better not let him know that we can
speak Indian, though. It might be to our advantage
later to know without being known."</p>

<p>"Quite right," answered the elder man. Then
he addressed the Indian again.</p>

<p>"We would ask, O Swift Arrow, for what
good purpose your braves have bound us. We
have been in peril from the waters; we seek the
friendship of your land. Is this the way the
Dacotahs treat their white brothers when they
seek the friendship of your shores?"</p>

<p>The Indian felt the reproach, and his eyes fell
for a moment with shame.</p>

<p>"The pale-face speaks words that go right into
the heart like burning arrows. But Swift Arrow
knows well that all things must be fulfilled. The
sun must come and the darkness follow. Then
darkness come, and after&mdash;the sun again. All
things must be as Manito<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> will."</p>

<p>The Englishmen looked at one another with
puzzled expressions.</p>

<p>"I wonder what he means by that?" questioned
Holden. "'All things must be fulfilled.' What
can that have to do with us?"</p>

<p>The Indian heard the question and understood.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span></p>

<p>"All things must be as Manito will," he
repeated; and Arnold, catching swiftly at the
words, demanded sharply&mdash;</p>

<p>"Is it willed that we be bound, as the Dacotahs
of old bound their captives for burning?"</p>

<p>This was evidently a point of view that had
not occurred to the redskin, for he was at a loss
for an immediate reply. He looked first at one
man and then at the other, after which he repeated
half aloud, half to himself, as if he were conning
the exact meaning of the words&mdash;</p>

<p>"<i>When the moon is round, and they rise out of
the silver waters&mdash;&mdash; </i>"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes!" interrupted Arnold, and speaking
at guesswork. "That is true. We know that&mdash;'out
of silver waters'&mdash;but is anything said about
bonds?"</p>

<p>The old man shook his head. He was deeply
puzzled.</p>

<p>"The pale-face speaks true, and it may be that
the redman is wrong. There are many trails,
but only one that leads to good hunting-ground.
How shall the redman's eyes see right?"</p>

<p>Then Arnold assumed an air of indifference
as he remarked carelessly, though not without a
certain sneer in his tone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p>"Does Swift Arrow ask a question of his
white brothers, or does he talk as old squaws
chatter&mdash;foolish words like running water? We
could tell him much, but it is well to know with
whom one speaks. Words may be wasted as
rain upon rocks."</p>

<p>"Let the pale-face speak," returned the Indian
with dignity, though it was plain that he was
moved by the sneering tones.</p>

<p>"Then listen. We who came 'out of the silver
waters,' as you put it, can tell you much. But
how can we speak in bonds? The pale-face is
a chief. He will not speak as a slave to his
master."</p>

<p>But the old man shook his head.</p>

<p>"It cannot be so, lest you return to the waters
from whence you came&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, that's it, is it?" exclaimed Arnold, with
sudden enlightenment. "If that's all, it's easily
settled. Look here&mdash;you know that when a pale-face
says he will do a thing he will surely do it?"</p>

<p>"My white brother's word is ever truth."</p>

<p>"And when we say we will not do a thing,
you know that we will keep our promise?"</p>

<p>The Indian bowed assent.</p>

<p>"Well, look here! If you will remove these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
cords, my friend and I will promise not to fight
and not to run away without telling you first that
we intend to do so. We will go with you where
you will. We are not foxes to hide behind
bushes; we are no half-breeds to hide behind
forked words. I have spoken."</p>

<p>The old man was immediately impressed by
this view of the situation. He retired for a few
minutes to consult with his friends, and afterwards
solemnly returned, accompanied by a couple
of young men.</p>

<p>"My white brother has spoken well," he said.
"The redman will take the word of his white
brother." Then he turned to the braves, gave
a brief order in Indian, and the next moment
Arnold and Holden stood up free.</p>

<p>"What next, I wonder?" questioned the latter,
as he looked inquiringly at Swift Arrow.</p>

<p>He was not kept long in doubt, for the old
man called the Indians together, signing to the
Englishmen to take places in the centre of the
group. Afterwards the company started on a
trail that led away from the lake through the
woods to the north-east.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>
<h3>LOST IN THE FOREST</h3>

<p>Morning came, but it brought no news
of the absent men. There now seemed
to be no possible doubt that some accident of a
serious nature had overtaken both, and the boys
were at their wits' end to know what steps to take.</p>

<p>There had been but one canoe for the outing,
so it was not possible to follow up the river course
in pursuit of explanation. The only course was
to take the journey on foot. That would be a
tedious process, seeing that the river twined in
some parts like a corkscrew. Two or three miles
might be walked, and yet only half the distance
might be covered as the crow flies. However,
there seemed nothing else to be done. It was
impossible to remain idly at the camp waiting for
what might turn up. Meantime, their services
might be urgently needed, and delay might only
increase the necessity.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span></p>

<p>"I vote we pack up our outfit in the tents and
set off on the chance of finding their tracks," said
Bob. "We can take a good supply of cartridges
with us, in case we are delayed and need to forage
for food."</p>

<p>"It's my opinion that we may have to go
a good long way," was Holden's view. "It
would be as well to take a small axe and one or
two things for possible camping. A pannikin
would be useful&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And a small coil of rope. You can never go
far in the bush without finding a use for rope."</p>

<p>"But suppose they come back in our absence?"</p>

<p>"Ah, that's well thought of," Arnold agreed.
"It might mean starting out to hunt for us.
We'll leave a note explaining things."</p>

<p>As soon as breakfast was over, the boys made
their preparations for departure. They filled
knapsacks with such supplies as they deemed
necessary to meet the circumstances and possible
emergencies. They packed away the loose
articles of the camp outfit, and pinned a note
against the flap of the tent to explain the cause
of their absence to any person who might reach
the ground before their return. Then they set
out bravely on their quest.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span></p>

<p>It was their first intention to follow the course
of the river, even though their journey might be
considerably lengthened thereby. But very soon
it was found that such tactics were, in the main, impracticable.
In some parts the banks were steep
and rocky; in others they were so thickly clothed
with bush that a pathway was only possible after
the axe had cut its way. The latter was
particularly the case when a certain great bend
of the Athabasca was reached, so the chums
determined to attempt a short cut across the loop
by plunging straight through the forest.</p>

<p>"It seems easy enough," Alf had said. "We
are going about due north, I think. The bend
goes due west, but as the main part of the river
flows north according to the map, if we go straight
on we are bound to strike the water again."</p>

<p>"Right, old man," responded Bob. "In any
case, the paters could not be so near home, or
they would have had plenty of time to get back,
even by crawling. So it would be almost wasting
energy to trudge so far out of the way."</p>

<p>It is one thing to say "go north," it is quite
another matter to hold a steady course in a
forest. The Indian can do it; likewise the
trapper. They know the signs of the compass<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
such as Nature has provided for them. They
know on which side of the trees certain moss is
to be found, and they know the signs that the
blizzard wind leaves behind it when it has passed
on its way from arctic zones. To such as have
been initiated into the higher mysteries of woodcraft
from their earliest years, a due course to any
set point of the compass is second nature. But
those who are unlearned in the art soon find out
their mistake when they put their inexperience
into practice. The sun is a pointing finger to
the craftsman&mdash;a disastrous lure to the ignorant.</p>

<p>Bob and Alf pursued their way pluckily.
Determined to keep a steady course, the tomahawk
had to be requisitioned at frequent intervals
in order to clear a passage through the thorns and
binding creepers that impeded the way.</p>

<p>At any other time the adventure would have
been one of sheer delight, for who would not
have enjoyed exploring unknown land&mdash;probably
land, too, where only the Indian's foot and the
feet of the wild creatures of the forest had ever
pressed?</p>

<p>Once or twice the boys saw the great velvet
eyes of an antelope peeping at them through a
screen of maple leaves. Again the scrub would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
rustle, as a fox crouched down to hide his skulking
body from the strangers' sight. The cat-birds
were calling their sad messages to each other
among the maple leaves, and lively little chipmunks
would utter their shrill piping sounds of
warning to their friends as they started before
the advance of the young explorers. Yes, it was
an experience to fill the heart with joy when any
ordinary call inspired the venture spirit.</p>

<p>On this occasion, however, neither of the boys
had eyes for such pleasant sights, or ears for such
sounds as are the delight of the trapper's life.
Their minds were too full of anxiety to permit
room for ordinary enjoyment, and they hardly
spoke as they pressed forward in single file.</p>

<p>In this way they continued for two hours or
more. At intervals they would take it in turn to
act as leader and handle the axe; but they did
not allow a pause in the pushing forward, until at
last Bob called a halt, feeling that a rest had
been earned.</p>

<p>"We ought to be getting near the river again
by this time," he remarked.</p>

<p>"That's what I've been thinking," said Alf.
"You see, it was such a sharp westward turn
that the river took after we crossed the ford, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
I don't think we can be far off now. It must
come round to the east again."</p>

<p>"Yet there's no sound of it&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That is what's puzzling me. We've covered
a couple of miles at the least."</p>

<p>"And done enough work for four," added Bob.
"However, let's get to work again. The sooner
there, the sooner this job will be over."</p>

<p>"Thank goodness it looks pretty clear ahead
now&mdash;more pine trees and less of the beastly
scrub," said Holden.</p>

<p>Once more the boys pressed forward; but,
although they continued the march for quite
another hour, apparently they were as far off as
ever from the river, for they neither sighted
water nor came within hearing distance of the
object of their search.</p>

<p>Again they stopped and faced one another with
perplexed expressions.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you what it is, old man&mdash;we've missed
the way," said Alf.</p>

<p>But Bob was never ready to admit defeat of
any sort.</p>

<p>"Nonsense," he said. "We've kept a fairly
straight course."</p>

<p>"Or thought we have. To my mind, if we'd<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
kept straight on we ought to have reached the
river by this time. As it is, there is no sign
of it."</p>

<p>"That's true. Except for being free from the
brushwood, we might almost be where we started.
It looks much the same&mdash;no slope or any other
sign to suggest that we are nearer to the water."</p>

<p>"What's to be done?"</p>

<p>"I see nothing for it but to go back again and
follow the river, as we were doing in the first
place. We were fools to think of taking short
cuts. The other way may have seemed longer,
but it would have been a deal shorter in the long-run."</p>

<p>Both the boys were feeling rather fagged by
this time, for their trudge had been of an exceptionally
fatiguing nature. But each kept the
thought to himself, and cheerfully stepped out
with the intention of retracing his steps. It was
a disappointment and irksome enough; yet there
was no help for it, and the situation had to be
faced pluckily.</p>

<p>But all the best intentions seemed to go wrong
that day, and it did not take an hour's marching
before Bob stopped and turned to his chum with
a crestfallen countenance.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span></p>

<p>"Look here, old man, I don't know what
you're thinking, but my own opinion is&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That we've missed the path; that we are
lost&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'm afraid that is the truth of it. You see,
we've never come to any of the places that we
had to clear with the tomahawk."</p>

<p>"Then what's to be done?" Alf questioned.</p>

<p>Arnold took out his watch and looked at it.</p>

<p>"What's to be done? Grub. That's the first
thing. After that we can make fresh plans. It's
noon now, and we can do nothing while we're
hungry. Besides&mdash;well, to tell the truth, I'm
feeling a little tired."</p>

<p>"I, too," responded Alf, with a faint smile.
"I didn't want to say so while I thought you
wished to go on&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Just my own idea," Bob returned, with a
slight laugh, as he lowered himself to a soft place
under the shadow of a large maple. "So we'll
rest here and have a bite. We'll feel better
afterwards."</p>

<p>The little camp was made, and a meal was
enjoyed from the contents of Bob's haversack&mdash;biscuits
and cold venison. Neither of the lads
thought it was worth while to trouble about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
shooting and cooking a meal just then. They
would reserve that till night, in the event of their
not being able to find Crane Creek again.</p>

<p>After a considerable rest, the march was
resumed for the third time. On this occasion,
however, the process was varied. Their first
purpose was, of course, to find the path by which
they had come; so at Bob's suggestion they
carefully proceeded to walk in a circle&mdash;checking
the route by notching the trees, and taking wider
courses each time a circuit was completed.</p>

<p>But even these means were ineffective. Circle
after circle was made, and still the earlier track
was undiscovered. All the afternoon was thus
occupied, and, when evening came, the boys were
footsore and weary&mdash;glad to throw themselves
down on the first piece of springy grass, too tired
even to trouble about preparing food.</p>

<p>The disappointment was beyond words. They
had started out in the morning full of cheerful
hopes of being able to render aid to their parents
who (they felt sure) were in need of assistance.
And now, not only was this purpose frustrated,
but they themselves were in that terrible plight
of being lost in the backwoods&mdash;a hundred miles
or more from the haunts of white men, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
nothing but plucky hearts to help them, and
limited ammunition to supply bodily needs.</p>

<p>The sun passed over their heads and sunk
somewhere beyond the forest. They could not
tell where it vanished, for the camp was amid
such dense surroundings that they could hardly
see beyond a hundred yards through the branches.</p>

<p>With dusk, and after a sparse meal, it was
decided to light a fire, more for the sake of the
cheering sight than the need for warmth.</p>

<p>Bob was the first to rise, and as he stood
upright he was heard to give vent to a decided&mdash;</p>

<p>"Bother it!"</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" grunted Alf, as he also
proceeded to rise.</p>

<p>"Matter?" repeated his chum. "Nothing;
only I have stuck my head into a cloud of moths&mdash;big
ones and little ones. There seems to be
a regular party going on under this tree."</p>

<p>"It's that luminous patch in the tree that we've
been sitting under," said Holden, at the same
time drawing his friend's attention to what looked
like a patch of light on the trunk of the maple
about five feet from the ground.</p>

<p>"That's curious," remarked Bob, bending forward
to examine the spot. "I wonder what it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
can be? It looks like the light on one of those
luminous match-boxes that are made so that you
can see them in the dark."</p>

<p>"They say that rotten wood sometimes has
that effect&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But this tree is quite sound. And see! There's
another the same on that tree to the right!"</p>

<p>It was certainly strange, and the boys picked
up their guns and sauntered over to examine the
next trunk, on which they found the same peculiar
light attracting an equally numerous lot of moths
of many descriptions.</p>

<p>"There's another!" exclaimed Alf, pointing
ahead of him.</p>

<p>"And another!"</p>

<p>"And another!"</p>

<p>By this time the boys were quite excited by
their discovery, and when Alf suddenly drew
attention to the further discovery that the marked
trees were almost in a straight line, their excitement
was still further stirred.</p>

<p>"It's the strangest thing I ever heard of&mdash;in
the natural history way," the younger lad said.
"To find all these trees marked on the same side,
and all in a straight line&mdash;why, it would puzzle
the brains of anybody to explain it!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span></p>

<p>Without any decided plan, and more out of
curiosity than from any other motive, the chums
proceeded from one tree to another, examining
each as they reached it, and marvelling all the
time at what they decided as being one of the
most remarkable freaks of Nature that they had
ever heard about.</p>

<p>Then they became aware of a strange sound
that reached them from no great distance through
the trees. It was a most remarkable sound&mdash;not
that of any animal with which they were familiar;
indeed, it was not a sound that suggested any
beast or bird.</p>

<p>"What on earth is it?" questioned Alf, as the
weird wail sighed through the forest.</p>

<p>"It sounds like a harmonium in distress!"
replied Bob, with a slight laugh. And even as
he spoke the wail was repeated, though this time
could be distinctly heard the voice of some person
struggling to articulate to some musical accompaniment
the words&mdash;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>
<h3>THE MEDICINE MAN</h3>

<p>During the march through the woods the
Indians were not communicative. Once
or twice Arnold attempted to draw Swift Arrow
into conversation, but the old man merely listened
in solemn silence. He refused even to respond
to direct questions.</p>

<p>Eventually a clearing was reached where a
large number of teepees were pitched. It was
quite a wigwam village, and thence the two
captives were escorted to a tent that stood among
many others. They were politely requested to
enter, and, on obeying, they found that the teepee
was otherwise empty. Several men were posted
on guard at a little distance from the entrance,
while Swift Arrow departed with the rest of his
brethren.</p>

<p>"There's no doubt but that we are prisoners,"
remarked Arnold, as he sat down upon a buffalo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
hide, preparing to make the best of things and
take his ease while he might.</p>

<p>"The whole affair is a puzzle," said his companion.
"Why on earth they should take us
prisoners passes my comprehension. It can't
be that they regard us as enemies. They would
not have been so polite and considerate if that
had been their thought."</p>

<p>"That's just it," laughed Arnold, who, like his
son, had the gift for worrying little until he knew
exactly what to worry about. "That's just what
surprises me. We are treated as prisoners, and
not as prisoners. My impression is that we are
regarded with more fear than anger."</p>

<p>The time allowed for speculation was soon
curtailed by the sound of many voices approaching
the tent, though presently there was silence,
and a loud voice called to those within&mdash;</p>

<p>"The eyes of Mighty Hand would gladly rest
on the sight of the White Men."</p>

<p>"He means us," commented Arnold, rising
from the couch of fur. "He's too polite to enter
the teepee uninvited."</p>

<p>"By all means let his eyes rest upon us,"
laughed Holden.</p>

<p>The two men then advanced, while one threw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
open the flap of the tent. And the picture that
met their eyes was one that struck the strangers
with admiration, for it seemed to throw the years
back to the days when the Indian ruled the prairie&mdash;the
days that knew the youth of Ballantyne
and the prime of Fenimore Cooper.</p>

<p>Ranged in a semicircle before the tent was a
crowd of braves and warriors&mdash;all arrayed in the
picturesque garb that was unspoilt by any touch
of Saxon attire, such as is commonly seen among
redskins of the present day. Except that the
old-time bows and arrows were replaced by more
modern muzzle-loaders, there was nothing to
suggest any association with white men and white
men's tastes.</p>

<p>But it was not so much the background of
natives that impressed the Englishmen. Their
admiration was called to the central figure. He
was an Indian of enormous size&mdash;tall, squarely
built, and equally proportioned. His head was
surmounted with a turban of black fox decorated
with eagle feathers that were continued like a
wing right down his back and nearly touched
the ground. His black hair was threaded with
many coloured beads, some of which resembled
(and actually were proved to be) nuggets of pure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
gold. Necklaces of beads and animals' teeth
hung in many strands upon the breast of his deerskin
shirt. Leggings and moccasins were a mass
of beads, feathers, and porcupines' quills woven
in intricately fantastic designs. And, over all,
there hung in graceful folds an ermine robe of
spotless white.</p>

<p>This was the great chief of the Dacotahs.
Mighty Hand was his name, and that hand was
famed for its deeds of valour as equally for its
deeds of kindness. He was sole monarch of a
mighty branch-tribe of the Dacotahs that had
long been separated from its renegade brethren,
preferring to maintain the old life in the forest and
on the prairie rather than a workhouse existence
in a Government Reserve. He led his people
far from the haunts of white men, and his life
was only harmful to the game that supplied his
people's needs. Powder and other necessaries
he obtained from frontier trading-stations. But
he was known as a man of peace and a man of
spotless honour. Hence his irregular life and
failure to comply with Government Reserve
regulations had been hitherto winked at by the
officials.</p>

<p>When the Englishmen issued from the tent,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
this chief was standing before them in a majestic
attitude that at once proclaimed his royal blood.
He was unarmed. This was a courtesy to the
strangers.</p>

<p>At the chief's right side stood Swift Arrow;
at the left was a figure that formed a weird
contrast to the other two. This one was lean,
bent, and twisted like a gnarled tree that had been
starved and warped in the forest. His dress was
alike native, but the grotesque ornaments of
animals' skulls, tails, dried monkeys' hands, and
other gruesome relics gave the wearer an appearance
that was repulsive to Saxon eyes. This
freak of figure and dress was Thunder-maker,
the great Medicine Man of the tribe. Without
his presence no state conclave was complete;
without his opinion no tribal law or ruling was
ever decided.</p>

<p>It must not be thought that the time we have
occupied in describing these several features was
similarly occupied by the Englishmen in minute
observation. Not at all. Arnold, immediately
recognising the bearing of the chief, promptly
addressed him in English, which Mighty Hand
could understand&mdash;judging from his first salutation.</p>

<p>"The white brothers of the redmen are gladdened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
by this visit of the great chief," he said.
"The white brothers have been in great danger
from rushing waters&mdash;danger from which the great
chief's braves snatched them. They are grateful
that their lives have been saved, and they are
glad to meet the chief and thank him for what
was done."</p>

<p>The Indian listened in silence, and, at the
pause that followed, he returned in deep tones,
as if he were repeating a lesson that he had learnt
by heart&mdash;</p>

<p>"<i>Out from the silver waters, when the moon is
round, they shall come. They shall be pale-face,
and they shall look like men.</i>"</p>

<p>This was certainly a puzzling rejoinder! To
neither of the captives did it convey any knowledge.
Arnold, however, deemed that the best
course would be to assume no impression that he
and his friend were regarded as prisoners.</p>

<p>"The chief speaks well," he returned. "But
his tongue deceives him when he says that we
<i>look</i> like men. Pale-faces we are. But we are
friends to the redman. We would smoke the
peace-pipe with him. But we are far from our
camp. At our tents are our young sons, who are
awaiting our return with anxious hearts. Perhaps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
the great chief has also a son! He will know,
then, how heavy would be the heart of his papoose
if the chief were long absent from his teepee.
We therefore beg that the chief will hasten the
peace-pipe. Afterwards he will lend a brave to
guide the white brothers back to their camp-ground."</p>

<p>While Arnold spoke there was silence among
the Indians, and it was obvious, from the chief's
face, that his mind was disturbed with indecision.</p>

<p>"Mighty Hand has listened to the words of
the pale-face," the chief said. "The white man's
words flow as music, but&mdash;'<i>out from the silver
waters, when the moon is round</i>&mdash;&mdash; '"</p>

<p>The speaker's voice faded into thoughtfulness,
and Holden whispered to his companion&mdash;</p>

<p>"What is the fellow driving at? What does
he mean by 'out from the silver waters'? Of
course we came out from waters, but what has
that to do with the moon, I wonder?"</p>

<p>"I can't think, unless&mdash;yes, I believe I've got
it! It's full moon about this time, Holden.
There's some Indian superstition, I imagine,
about full moon and people being rescued from
the water&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It sounds like that from the way he speaks.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
You remember Swift Arrow said much the same
thing."</p>

<p>"Then depend upon it we've hit the mark.
In some way we've got mixed up with a legend
or superstition."</p>

<p>Mighty Hand had been consulting with Swift
Arrow while the Englishmen had been quietly
summing up the situation, but now he again faced
the captives.</p>

<p>"Mighty Hand has lived long and seen many
wonders and much great medicine. But to-day
there is a cloud in his mind. He understands
but darkly. It would be a shame that Mighty
Hand should bring water to the eyes of his white
brother's papoose, but who can say if the Fiery
Totem be not calling this day? Behold!"</p>

<p>As he spoke the chief tore open his deerskin
shirt, and when the Englishmen bent forward in
curiosity they saw&mdash;upon the naked breast&mdash;the
figure of a serpent tattooed in gold and red so
cunningly that it seemed as though a living
reptile were there resting&mdash;a reptile moulded
from burning flames, with head raised in the
attitude of striking.</p>

<p>The men gave a gasp of wonder and surprise,
and at the same instant the Medicine Man jumped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
forward, pointed a finger towards the sign, and
turned with an evil grin towards the strangers.</p>

<p>"The totem of the Serpent Dacotahs!" he
hissed through his teeth. "Can the pale-face
look upon it without fear? Can they not feel
the poison-tooth break the covering of their
flesh?"</p>

<p>At this strange attack Arnold laughed aloud,
and Holden smiled as he said&mdash;</p>

<p>"The white men are not cowards! They do
not shrink before a figure of paint!"</p>

<p>The Medicine Man threw up his arms in a
transport of rage.</p>

<p>"They laugh! The white men smile at the
sacred totem!" he cried in a wild appeal to the
sympathies of the people, who began to respond
with disapproving murmurs. "Shall it be that
the fiery serpent hear laughing tongues while the
hands of the Dacotahs are idle? <i>Who</i> are they
that dare to revile our sacred sign with mocking
eyes and tongues?"</p>

<p>Matters were beginning to assume a serious
aspect towards the strangers, for evidently the
Medicine Man was one whose lead was followed
by his people, and who knew well how to play
upon their weaknesses. So Arnold hastened to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
try and pacify the anger that he had inadvertently
roused.</p>

<p>"My red brother mistakes," he said, addressing
Thunder-maker. "The white man's laughter was
at the suggestion of fear. We are brave men who
fear nothing. But we did no insult to the totem
of the Dacotahs&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Dogs!" exclaimed the furious Indian.
"Dogs! The fiery totem has been defiled.
Revenge, my brothers! Revenge! lest the
names Dacotah and Mighty Hand become
things for jeers and laughter in the women's
tents!"</p>

<p>The Indian was quite frantic with passion, and
as he flung his wild appeal to his people the
murmurs suddenly burst into a flood of angry
roars&mdash;knives were snatched from their sheaths,
a hundred arms were lifted, and the circle quickly
closed upon the helpless men. But just at that
moment of peril and almost inevitable death, the
great figure of Mighty Hand was seen to start.
He stepped forward with one stride, turned his
back upon the captives, and then raised his arms,
from which his robe hung like great protecting
wings that shielded the strangers beneath their
folds. And his voice rang out above the angry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
clamour like the voice of a wind roaring through
the pine forests.</p>

<p>"Back, Dacotahs! Back to your tents ere the
strength of Mighty Hand is lifted and you sink
to the dust! Is this how the redman treats the
stranger who would smoke the peace-pipe by
our fire? Is this the welcome that my braves
give to those whom Mighty Hand has received
with a smile&mdash;with no arms in his hand, no
tomahawk at his belt? Back, dogs! and hide
your coward faces like frightened papooses in the
skirts of the women!"</p>

<p>The clamour ceased instantly. The men hung
back, and their heads bent with shame, that is,
all heads but that of Thunder-maker. His face
betokened no shame. Nay, greater fury than
ever was depicted, though he was silenced before
the anger of his chief. But it was only for a
little while that he was thus disconcerted, for
soon he resumed&mdash;though now he spoke with
humble fawning&mdash;</p>

<p>"It is death in the heart of Thunder-maker
when the eyes of Mighty Hand shoot their looks
of fire. But&mdash;<i>Thunder-maker speak true</i>. Has
he not made great medicine these many suns?
Did he not bring the thunder to prove his great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
medicine? Has he not many times driven the
fever from the camp, till it fled over the prairie
like a coyote driven with sticks and dogs? Huh!
many wonders has he done, and&mdash;more will he
do. He will do great medicine this day. He
will show if the fiery totem has called in vain
for vengeance."</p>

<p>Thus speaking, Thunder-maker dived a hand
into the bosom of his shirt and drew out a bundle
of dirty linen. The chief had lowered his arms,
so that the Englishmen could now see the Indian
as he laughed and held up the bundle triumphantly
above his head.</p>

<p>"Great medicine!" he exclaimed, fixing his
eyes upon the white men. "Great medicine!
Look! See! Listen!"</p>

<p>They looked, and as they looked they saw the
linen move, as if something inside were struggling
to be free, and at the same time they heard a
sound like the sudden springing of an old-time
policeman's rattle.</p>

<p>"Rattlesnakes!" exclaimed Arnold under his
breath.</p>

<p>Thunder-maker laughed when he saw that the
sound had been recognised.</p>

<p>"Come! Come, my children!" he cried, as he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
turned his face upwards. "Come, my little son&mdash;come,
my little daughter!"</p>

<p>Then he shook the knot of the bundle, and
out from the aperture crept two grey-green
bodies&mdash;a pair of twisting, writhing somethings
that caused the onlookers to shudder and the
Medicine Man to laugh, as he repeated carelessly&mdash;</p>

<p>"Come, my little papooses! You will speak
great medicine in the ears of Thunder-maker!"</p>

<p>Slowly the serpents came from their covering.
One remained coiled on the raised wrists, the
other&mdash;still sounding the ominous rattle&mdash;moved
slowly downwards till it rested on the man's
shoulder. Then Thunder-maker inclined his
head, as if listening to a whisper. Afterwards
his face lit up with understanding.</p>

<p>"Huh!" he exclaimed. "Did not the spirit
of Thunder-maker speak true? Come, my little
papoose! You shall show for whom the fiery
totem called."</p>

<p>Turning his head so as to look along his
shoulder, the Indian suddenly grabbed the writhing
reptile with his teeth, after which (holding the
other serpent with his right hand) he commenced
dancing until he had cleared an open<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
circular space, of which the Indians and the white
men formed the border.</p>

<p>Suddenly he sprang to the middle and tossed
the snake to the ground, while he uttered a wild
shriek.</p>

<p>Once on the earth, the snake glided swiftly
in several directions, while all watched the
creature with tense excitement. Then for a
second it seemed to pause with its head in
the direction of the Englishmen. At the same
moment the Indian gave a cry of triumph, tucked
the one snake into a fold of his robe and bent
down, making passes with his hands above the
serpent on the ground. And as his hands moved
so the rattlesnake gradually straightened out its
body till it lay stiff and straight as a piece of
wood.</p>

<p>Thunder-maker paused. Then he rose up
slowly and looked with triumph straight into
the chief's face.</p>

<p>"My children say that the time has come to
take the cloud from the Dacotah. My papooses
show <i>who</i> answer call of fiery totem!"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>
<h3>THE FRIEND IN NEED</h3>

<p>Even considering the serious nature of their
quest and the plight they were in, it was
not possible for the boys to refrain from laughing
when they recognised Britain's national song as
caricatured by the singer. But they had sufficient
wisdom to control most of their amusement to
"inward laughing." It is not always safe in
the backwoods to announce your presence too
suddenly where strangers are concerned&mdash;especially
strangers who are not of the white skin.</p>

<p>"That's a rum sort of music to come upon a
hundred miles from nowhere," remarked Bob,
with a grin, to his chum.</p>

<p>"Let's hope that it comes from a throat that
has something of civilisation about it," said Alf.</p>

<p>"It doesn't sound quite like a white man.
That 'ne-vaire' is more French accent than
English&mdash;probably a half-breed."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span></p>

<p>"What do you think we ought to do?"</p>

<p>"Investigate. We've got no choice. We're
lost; that's certain enough. What's more, there
seems to be very little chance of finding our own
trail back to the camp."</p>

<p>"That's true enough," Alf assented. "But
suppose we come upon a camp of half-breeds, as
you suggested? I've heard that they're not the
best of friends to white people in out-of-the-way
places."</p>

<p>Arnold nodded in agreement.</p>

<p>"I dare say that's true. But, at the same time,
most yarns of the kind have usually got large bits
of ornamental stuff stuck round the facts. We'll
have to take our chance of falling in with friends
or foes."</p>

<p>"Right-away. If you're ready, I'm ready also,"
said Alf promptly. "It will be a strange thing
if 'Rule Britannia' leads Britons into a mess
instead of out of one."</p>

<p>Having thus determined what course to pursue,
the two boys began to creep cautiously through
the bush towards the locality from whence still
proceeded the music that was being repeated
with all the diligence of some one who was
determined to learn his lesson thoroughly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span></p>

<p>The night was now quite dark, but presently
the chums were able to distinguish the flickering
of a camp-fire at no great distance before
them.</p>

<p>Taking every care not to betray their presence
by any careless footstep, they twined a path with
all the success that a professional tracker would
have admired. Then, penetrating a more than
usually dense portion of the bush, the young
explorers found themselves right on the edge of
the encampment, and the picture that they then
discovered was one that was surely calculated to
drive away all melancholy thoughts and feelings
of fatigue, for the time being at least.</p>

<p>Seated on the end of a water-keg, in front of a
moderate-sized "A" tent, was a man of gigantic
size whose black hair stood up from his head as
if he were constantly seeing ghosts, and whose
equally black beard streamed down his breast
like a cataract of ink. He was dressed in a blue
shirt, corduroy trousers protected with cowboy
"shaps," and heavy top-boots. In his hands was
an accordion, at his side sat a collie dog, while
in front of him, with his back to the fire&mdash;standing
with his hands behind his back in the attitude of
a schoolboy repeating a lesson&mdash;was a tousle-headed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
half-breed, whom he of the black beard
was addressing in encouraging tones&mdash;</p>

<p>"Noo then, ma callant, we'll just be having
that last line ower again. It's no' bad as an
eemitation o' a cat left oot on a winter's night;
but it's no' just what I call 'ceevilised'; no' just
quite that&mdash;yet."</p>

<p>Then the accordion sounded a dismal chord
suggestive of an attack of asthma, the half-breed
reattacked the "ne-vaire, ne-vaire, ne-vaire" in a
manner that made up in energy what it lacked in
music, and the collie raised his head to add a long-drawn
wail to the concert.</p>

<p>"That's a wee bit better," was the player's
verdict at the finish. "I'm thinking we'll make a
ceevilised creature oot o' you in time, Haggis."
Then the speaker turned to the dog. "As for
you, Bannock, you're a bit oot o' tune at times.
But it's no' that bad for a doggie. It's good to
be aye trying to do our best&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hear! hear!" shouted Bob, whose interested
amusement had quite banished his caution.</p>

<p>The effect of the boy's applause was electric.
The two men started. The half-breed snatched
up a gun that was leaning against a tree near by;
one hand of the bearded man deposited the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
musical instrument upon the ground as his right
picked up a handy rifle; while Bannock, the
dog, crouched down with bristling hair and deep
growling.</p>

<p>"Come oot and show yourself, whoever ye
be!" commanded the master, as he raised himself
to his great height, with rifle in readiness
and eyes staring towards that part of the bush
where the chums stood. "Come forward this
instant, or I'll bore as many holes in your body
as there are farthings in a pound!"</p>

<p>In obedience to the gentle invitation, and not
in the least nervous, now that they knew who the
musicians were, the boys immediately made their
appearance.</p>

<p>"There's no need to be afraid&mdash;&mdash;" began
Holden reassuringly, when he was interrupted by
a huge guffaw of derision.</p>

<p>"Afraid! And what for shall Skipper Mackintosh
be afraid? Unless it's mosquitoes, there's no
man or beast in Canada that'll turn a hair on his
hide." Then, seeing the lads as they approached
into the firelight, the man immediately changed his
tone of address as he also altered the threatening
pose of his rifle. "What! A pair o' laddies?" he
exclaimed in astonishment, and Bob replied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p>"Neither of whom is particularly anxious to be
riddled with a pound's worth of farthing bullets!"</p>

<p>But the words had barely passed the boy's
lips before the rifle had been dropped to the
ground and the man had sprung forward excitedly
to grab a hand of each boy in his great fists.</p>

<p>"Faix! but this is a fine sight for sore eyes!"
he exclaimed, as he vigorously pumped the arms
up and down. "I've no' seen a white face
(barring a trader's, and that was ower dirty to
call it 'white') this twelvemonth past. I'm right
glad to see you!"</p>

<p>"And I guess we're jolly glad to see you,"
returned Alf. "It's a treat, but&mdash;speaking for
myself, I really want to use my hand again. It'll
be jelly in a few more seconds."</p>

<p>"And mine too!" laughed Bob, who could not
help wincing at the vigorous form of the welcome.</p>

<p>The Scotsman immediately released his severe
grasp.</p>

<p>"Sakes! But I'm that glad to see you, laddies,
I feel just like squeezing for another hour. I
suppose, noo, that I'm no' just dreaming?
You're no' by chance just twa o' them muckle
moths that's come into my dream in a make-believe?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span></p>

<p>"We're human, sure enough," Arnold laughed
in reply, and Alf added&mdash;</p>

<p>"Terribly human we are, for we've lost our
way in the forest, and we're beastly tired as well
as hungry."</p>

<p>"Lost&mdash;tired&mdash;hungry?" repeated Mackintosh.
"That has a human sound&mdash;terribly
human, as you say." Then he turned towards
the half-breed, who had been standing an amazed
spectator of the scene. "Did you hear that,
Haggis?" he demanded. "Did you hear that&mdash;'hungry
and tired'?"</p>

<p>"Haggis hear," was the quiet reply of the
native, to which the Scot retorted angrily&mdash;</p>

<p>"You heard? And yet, one meenit after, I
see you standing there like a daft gowk instead
o' hustling for food as fast as your legs can move
you? Ma conscience! But you tak' a deal of
ceevilising! You dinna ken the first meaning o'
the word 'hospitality.' Off wi' you!"</p>

<p>There was no need to repeat the order, for the
half-breed immediately disappeared within the
tent, and the almost simultaneous rattling sound
of tin-ware was evidence of his haste to supply
the want.</p>

<p>Mackintosh then turned to the boys.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span></p>

<p>"Noo then, rest yourselves, laddies. Sit doon
by the fire, and you'll soon have a bit o' something
to grind between your molars. Haggis is
slow to understand, but he's quick enough when
he kens what's wanted."</p>

<p>Not unwillingly, the chums soon stretched
themselves in comfortable positions beside the
camp-fire at either side of their eccentric host.
Bannock, however, still eyed the strangers with
suspicion, so Mackintosh was forced to introduce
the dog formally to each boy in turn, at which
the intelligent animal extended a paw with all
the air of one who is accustomed to polite
society.</p>

<p>"He's a fine chap," explained the Scot.
"There's no' a single thing that he canna do
(according to the leemitations o' Nature) except
speak. And even that he manages to do in his
ain way. Noo, come here, Bannock, and lie
down while oor freends spin us their yarn.
They've no' told us yet who they are, where they
come frae, nor where they're going."</p>

<p>"That's a yarn that's quickly told," remarked
Bob. The half-breed by this time had returned
from the tent with generous supplies of cold deer,
damper, and wild berries, after serving which he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
placed a pan on the fire in preparation for coffee.
"It's a yarn that won't take long in the telling,
though, if you'll excuse me, I'll eat while I speak."</p>

<p>"Eat awa'," assented the other, while he lit a
corn-cob pipe to satisfy his own immediate wants.
"There's plenty mair where that came frae, and
the coffee will soon be ready!"</p>

<p>Arnold then launched into a brief recital of
his and his chum's adventures, beginning with the
departure of their fathers on the previous morning,
and concluding&mdash;</p>

<p>"So all this afternoon we've been wandering
about trying to find a path back to our camp, so
as to start afresh by the river course. But it was
no use."</p>

<p>"And we might have been wandering still if it
had not been for a strange accident that led us
here," added Alf, at which remark Mackintosh
questioned&mdash;</p>

<p>"And what might that be? The soond o'
Haggis's nightingale voice?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;at least, not in the first place. We
heard that later. What first started us in this
direction was a curious sort of light that we discovered
on one of the trees. And while we were
examining it we noticed that there were other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
lights on other trees in a straight line with one
another. Strange, wasn't it?"</p>

<p>"Very," returned the Scotsman dryly. "Very
strange."</p>

<p>"It would be a good thing for a naturalist,"
said Bob. "I noticed that there was a perfect
cloud of moths flying about wherever there was a
patch of light. A collector of moths and butterflies
would reap a harvest. I suppose you've
noticed the lights as well as we?"</p>

<p>"H'm&mdash;yes&mdash;considering that I painted the
trees mysel' this afternoon," was the reply. "It's
an invention o' my own. I'm what <i>you</i> call a
collector of moths and butterflies. An entomologist
is a shorter way o' putting it. Well,
there's many folks stick to treacle&mdash;I mean, stick
to the auld-fashioned way o' putting dabs of
treacle and speerit on trees to attract the nocturnal
creatures. That's all very fine and good.
But you canna carry gallons o' treacle on a tramp
like this, when your whole outfit must be packed
on one pony. So says I to mysel': 'Moths are
attracted by light; I must invent a composeetion
o' phosphorus to take the place o' treacle.' And
those lights that you found on yon trees are the
result."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span></p>

<p>"And a splendid idea it is!" exclaimed Alf,
who had also done his little share of treacling at
school. "Is it a success?"</p>

<p>"Magnificent. I've found more moths than
were known to exist in the West. I'm thinking
that I'll open the eyes o' the Royal Edinburgh
Entomological General Natural History Exchange
Society when I get back again after my journeys.
But&mdash;&mdash;" The speaker here paused in his enthusiasm,
remarking seriously, "I'm thinking there's
other matters o' mair importance before us the noo
than moths. Your faithers went doon the Athabasca,
you said?"</p>

<p>"Yes; in a canoe," said Bob.</p>

<p>Mackintosh shook his head ominously.</p>

<p>"That's bad. I suppose they'd never been
there before&mdash;indeed, it was no' possible, or
they'd never have made the attempt yesterday."</p>

<p>"Is it&mdash;dangerous?" questioned Holden, in an
undertone of dread, for the man's voice conveyed
no small impression of the risks the voyagers had
run. "We had not thought of danger in the
river. We only thought of moose."</p>

<p>Mackintosh grunted uneasily.</p>

<p>"The river is more treacherous than any
moose. There's a terrible narrow bight atween<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
cliffs where it runs like lightning, and then shoots
in a waterfall into the Silver Lake. Man! I've
seen great trunks o' pine giants flung through yon
opening like wee arrows a hundred feet in the air
afore they touched water again."</p>

<p>"Then a canoe&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"If it reached so far in safety it would shoot
likewise."</p>

<p>"You think it possible that the canoe <i>might</i>
pass the gully unharmed?" Bob then questioned.
It was always his nature to struggle for the
brightest view, and the man's answer was somewhat
in the same spirit.</p>

<p>"It's no' the way o' Skipper Mackintosh to find
trouble until trouble finds him. He's been in a'
the back corners o' Europe, Africa, India, China,
and America; and, if he learned nothing mair
from his travels, he learned this: troubles are
easier conquered when you meet them wi' a firm
lip at the proper time. But the man that moans
before he kens what he's moaning about&mdash;well,
it's little strength he's got left when the fight really
begins."</p>

<p>"Yet if, as you say, the Athabasca is so
dangerous&mdash;&mdash;" began Alf, when he was again
interrupted with kindly roughness.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span></p>

<p>"If? Laddie, laddie, are you forgetting that
there's a Hand that could guide the frailest birch-bark
safely through Niagara itsel'? And I doot
not that I'm right when I say that it's my opeenion
that that same Hand has no' been very far from
your faithers in their plight. Does either o' you
ken anything o' this by chance?"</p>

<p>As he spoke Mackintosh dived his hand into
the hip-pocket of his overalls and produced a
white handkerchief which he spread out upon the
ground by the fire. The boys bent forward, and
immediately Alf exclaimed&mdash;</p>

<p>"That's my father's! See! His initials are at
the corner. Where did you find it?"</p>

<p>"<i>Not</i> in the Athabasca!" said Mackintosh
with quiet triumph. "Haggis and I came upon
it this morning a hundred yards from Silver
Lake."</p>

<p>"Then that means that they are on shore!"
exclaimed Bob with delight at the relief from one
anxiety that the evidence of the handkerchief
provided.</p>

<p>"Ay. The Athabasca is free from that charge,
at any rate. That hanky has no legs to walk by
itsel'. It must have been carried. By whom?
No' by an Indian, though I ken there's been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
Indians in the viceenity. If a redskin had found
it, he'd have taken better care o' it. And so it's
clear to me that one o' your faithers must have
dropped it on dry land, and so&mdash;so&mdash;&mdash; Well,
you both o' you can have a sound night's rest."</p>

<p>So convincing were the tones in which the man
clothed his words that the spirits of the boys were
quickly stirred from gloomy anticipations to comparative
cheerfulness.</p>

<p>"You've lifted a load from my mind, Mr. Mackintosh,"
Bob said gratefully, "for of course it is all
fairly plain now. As likely as not they passed
through that horrible gully, but were too worn
out yesterday to start the trudge back to camp.
It would be a long way, too, seeing how the river
winds."</p>

<p>"In that case, most likely they are back at the
camp by this time," suggested Alf. "But they
would understand our being away, for they would
find the note that we pinned to the tent."</p>

<p>"That's right, laddies. Look for the bright
side and you'll always find it," the Scotsman
remarked. "But I'm thinking that your reasoning
is a wee bit oot in one respect&mdash;they have no'
gone back yet, else Haggis or I would have seen
them. This camp is in the direct natural path<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
from that part o' the Athabasca. My opeenion
is that they've fallen in with the Indians&mdash;a tribe
o' Dacotahs, and peaceable folk they are. It's no'
to be expected that the gully could be passed
unscathed. So it's likely to me that they're nursing
themselves for a day wi' the redskins, after,
maybe, sending a brave to your camp to tell you
o' it. So to-morrow we'll lose no time in starting
for Silver Lake. That's the best plan I can
think o'."</p>

<p>"You mean to come with us?" asked Alf.</p>

<p>"What do you take me for&mdash;a savage?" was
the reproachful return. "Do you think that
Skipper Mackintosh is going to allow twa laddies
like you to go wandering aboot the backwoods
when he can guide you? And when Skipper
fails, is there no' the Haggis and Bannock&mdash;a pair
o' the finest scouts and trackers that ever set foot
in bush or prairie? What do you take me for,
I'd just like to know?"</p>

<p>"One of the kindest hearts in the world, Mr.
Mackintosh," said Bob fervently.</p>

<p>"Bah! Fiddlesticks and porridge-sticks!"
was the rough rejoinder, though a pair of eyes
were turned kindly enough upon the youths&mdash;eyes
that glistened in a way that rather suggested<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
the nearness of water. "All a pack o' nonsense!
If a man is no' ready to help his fellow-creatures
when they need him&mdash;well, I'm thinking that he
ought to have a pin stuck through his thorax and
mounted in a box among my moths, labelled,
'A horrible freak o' Nature.' And I'd have you
know, too, that my name is Mackintosh&mdash;Skipper
Mackintosh. There's no 'Misters' in the backwoods.
'Skipper' is the name that my auld
faither gave me to commemorate his discovery o'
a new variety of skippers in the entomological
world. Mind that, and&mdash;and good-night to you,
laddies. Good-night, and God bless the pair o'
you."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
<h3>NIGHT IN THE WIGWAM</h3>

<p>While the two boys had been holding
their lonely watch at the camp prior
to setting forth the following morning on their
disappointing search, matters of serious moment
were taking place at the encampment of Mighty
Hand and his brother Dacotahs.</p>

<p>Thunder-maker's triumph had been complete.
The savage mind seldom looks for a simple
explanation of anything that surprises him.
When the unusual is not understood, he does
not search for a simple and natural explanation.
He immediately flies to the supernatural and
attributes to good and evil spirits actions that a
little common sense would have readily explained
in an everyday way.</p>

<p>The Medicine Man of a tribe is different from
others of his race. He is the brainy exception
of craft united to common sense, and he uses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
these to best advantage for his own interests.
Thunder-maker's method of divining was very
simple after all&mdash;nay, even childish. We have
seen it performed by redskin jugglers, as we have
also seen the same effects produced by Arab
diviners on the Syrian desert.</p>

<p>The explanation is found in the fact that
serpents are exceedingly sensitive to blows. A
cut with an ordinary willow wand is usually
sufficient to break the spine and disable all but
the monsters of the class. At the same time,
although the first blow may daze a snake, it is
some time before the final effect takes place, and
the creature will wriggle about for some time
after having been struck, while its energy is
practically nil&mdash;that is to say, it merely lives
without possessing any real strength.</p>

<p>Now, Thunder-maker's cunning was well aware
of all this, and when he dropped the rattler from
his teeth he was careful to do so in such a way
that the creature would touch the ground with
considerable violence. Then he allowed it to
wriggle about until in time its head faced the
Englishmen. That was the moment for which
he had waited, and immediately he started forward
with a cry that startled the snake into still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
fear. A few passes with his hands fascinated the
creature long enough for the Medicine Man to
show the Indians that the creature was undoubtedly
pointing in the direction of the captives,
and when that was done the crafty redskin had
achieved his purpose:</p>

<p>The serpent had divined whom the sacred
totem of the tribe had called that day.</p>

<p>Then Thunder-maker had replaced his assistant
in the linen cloth before it revived sufficiently to
commence wriggling again, and, perhaps, point
its supernatural head to some one else.</p>

<p>Both Arnold and Holden had observed how
Mighty Hand had been wavering between
reason and superstition until the intervention of
the Medicine Man had caused superstition to
take the uppermost place. A moment before,
and the chief would have released the captives
and sent them back to their camp in charge of a
guide. But the art of Thunder-maker had stepped
in to convince the people that the sacred totem
of their tribe had been calling that day, and that
it was the Englishmen for whom it called.</p>

<p>Why?</p>

<p>Ah, that was what the strangers found inexplicable.
Of this, however, there was no doubt:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
their arrival had been at a most unfortunate time,
when some answer to the supposed call of the
totem was then expected. They were that
answer, and the result&mdash;who can say what the
consequences would be when falsehood and
superstition had a savage people at command?</p>

<p>So the Englishmen were requested to return
within the teepee that had been reserved for their
prison. But, curiously enough, they were not
treated in any way after the traditional Indian
mode of treating prisoners. They were not
bound; no guard was placed at the entrance,
though sentries were placed round the camp of
which the prison teepee was the centre. The
best food that the Indians possessed was supplied
to them, as well as a sufficiency of fur robes to
sleep upon. All the same, in spite of these kindnesses
and other thoughtful attentions, there was
no room for doubting that they were prisoners
who were not to be allowed any opportunity for
escape, and the men could only accept the present
situation in a philosophic spirit, and await the
course of events with such patience as they
could muster.</p>

<p>As the day passed, and darkness fell upon the
forest, the Englishmen stretched themselves upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
the robes, while in whispers they tried to arrive
at the solution of the mystery and form some
sort of plan for future action.</p>

<p>"It's all owing to that scoundrel Thunder-maker,"
Arnold said. "If he had not stepped
in, Mighty Hand would have released us. I
could see by his face that he was favourably
disposed towards us."</p>

<p>"It is a serious business," said Holden.</p>

<p>"Serious enough for us, for there is no knowing
what may happen when people get mixed up with
native superstitions. At the same time, what I
worry about most is the boys."</p>

<p>Holden sighed at the thought of Bob and his
son Alf being alone at the deserted camp.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said. "It will be hard on them if
anything happens to us&mdash;miles away from civilised
habitations. Of course, I don't give up hope of
coming out of this right enough in the long-run,
and we may be worrying over very little after all.
But meantime&mdash;the boys&mdash;I wonder what they
are doing now?"</p>

<p>At this question the elder man gave a slight
laugh.</p>

<p>"You wonder?" he repeated. "I don't think
you need go very far for the answer if you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
haven't quite forgotten our own schooldays.
What would you and I have done if two of our
chums had disappeared from camp as we did?"</p>

<p>"Gone to look for them," was the prompt reply,
to which Arnold resumed&mdash;</p>

<p>"And I think there's not so very much difference
between Arnold and Holden <i>pères</i> and <i>fils</i>.
You take my word for it: at this very minute the
youngsters have summed up the situation and are
planning a rescue expedition, if, indeed, they have
not already set out. Neither Bob nor Alf is the
sort of chap to sit still and moan at such a time."</p>

<p>"Yes, I believe you are right. Neither of the
youngsters would allow himself to be knocked
over by the first difficulty. And they would know
that some accident must have taken place, for we
promised to be back at camp by dinner-time."</p>

<p>"All the same, we don't want them to be mixed
up in this affair in the event of their coming on
our track," said Arnold. "We must contrive to
prevent that, but&mdash;&mdash; Hullo! Who's this?"</p>

<p>A dark outline had suddenly filled the space at
the opening of the tent at this juncture, but the
Englishmen were not left long in doubt of the
nature of their late visitor, for a voice addressed
them in Indian accents.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span></p>

<p>"Thunder-maker would speak words of counsel
with his white brothers."</p>

<p>"Oh, he would, would he?" returned Arnold,
and his companion added&mdash;</p>

<p>"There was very little friendship about
Thunder-maker this afternoon."</p>

<p>The Indian gave a low laugh, as though he
were thoroughly enjoying some secret joke.</p>

<p>"There are days when hunter's path must be
straight; there are days when crooked trail lead
him where he find much deer. To-day&mdash;crooked
trail. But Thunder-maker friend. He would
speak in ear of white brother&mdash;low, soft. Thunder-maker
wise man. He speak words of wisdom to
his friends. But&mdash;none may hear but pale-face."</p>

<p>"By that you mean that you want to come
into the teepee?" said Arnold. "All right.
Come along. And if you have any sense to
speak of, out with it."</p>

<p>The Indian noiselessly entered and took a
seat on the robes between the Englishmen. He
did not speak during these movements, but when
he was comfortably settled he turned to Holden
and addressed him in a whisper&mdash;</p>

<p>"Night dark, and red men sleep&mdash;all but
braves, who watch that white men no return to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
Silver Lake." And a second time the Medicine
Man laughed quietly.</p>

<p>"Silver Lake!" returned Holden. "I shouldn't
think we need any watching to prevent that.
Without a canoe, Silver Lake is not much use
to us."</p>

<p>"Still&mdash;braves watch. They believe that white
men return to waters. They came without canoes;
they go back without canoes."</p>

<p>"Fools!" exclaimed Holden. "What do they
think we are? Spirits?"</p>

<p>"Huh! My white brother speaks true.
Indians&mdash;<i>some</i> Indians&mdash;fools," answered
Thunder-maker, at which Holden uttered an
exclamation betokening sudden enlightenment.</p>

<p>"By Jove, Arnold! That's it! That explains
the whole business. These idiots take us for
spirits, since they saw us scramble out from the
lake without any boat in sight. Spirits! It's
almost too silly to believe."</p>

<p>"Yet that's what Thunder-maker means,"
said Arnold, to whom the solution of the mystery
was now equally clear. "That is what you wish
us to understand, isn't it, Thunder-maker?"</p>

<p>"The understanding of the white man travels
quick."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span></p>

<p>"And that accounts for the kind treatment&mdash;the
food, half-freedom, and the rest. But if your
people think us spirits, why do they keep us
here? Why not let us return?"</p>

<p>The Indian paused for a moment before he
replied, after which he remarked quietly, and with
a peculiar inflection of tone that added deep
meaning to his words, while at the same time it
betrayed the fact that there was some curious
reason to account for this confidence&mdash;</p>

<p>"Dacotahs fools. They think white brothers
spirits&mdash;<i>evil</i> spirits. They have not the eyes of
Thunder-maker."</p>

<p>"I see," said Arnold thoughtfully. "But you
forget, Thunder-maker, that your trickery with
the snakes helped them to that opinion."</p>

<p>Once more the Medicine Man laughed quietly
in a manner that irritated his hearers, and Holden
broke in roughly&mdash;</p>

<p>"Come now, you old cheat, explain yourself!
<i>You</i> didn't believe as the rest of your people did.
And if not, why did you behave in such a double
way? Out with it. You had some purpose in
coming here to-night, and you may as well give
us the truth right away."</p>

<p>It is not possible to hasten an Indian in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
matter of speech. Hasty response or rapid talk
they deem discourteous. Thunder-maker was no
exception to his race in this respect, but he was
exceptional in another, inasmuch as when bent
on a subject he stuck to it without using many
unnecessary words or ornaments of speech. He
waited in thoughtful silence for several minutes.
Possibly in his cunning way he was mentally
scrutinising the peculiarities of his companions in
the teepee&mdash;deciding what course would be best
to enable him to be assured of their trust.
Whether or not he judged their characteristics
correctly will be seen later.</p>

<p>"My white brother has asked for the truth,"
the Indian began. "Thunder-maker shall speak
words as straight as the path of a burning arrow.</p>

<p>"Many years ago&mdash;when the buffalo lived
upon the prairie to feed the redman and provide
his robes&mdash;the great tribe of Dacotahs would
hunt in the valley that is known even to-day as
the Peace Camp. Many deer would feed there,
and the buffalo would eat the blue grass, and
Manito had filled the camp with fruit and flowers.
In those days the Dacotahs were ruled by a
mighty warrior, Flying Cloud&mdash;the son of the
fiery totem serpent that saved his life by slaying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
the chief of the Chippeways in the war-path by
night."</p>

<p>Here the speaker paused, as though he
expected some comment from the listeners
regarding the seeming miracle. But no remark
being forthcoming, he resumed&mdash;</p>

<p>"For many years our tribe lived in prosperity.
Pemmican was in plenty, and the redmen kept
the hunting-grounds in peace. Then&mdash;one night&mdash;Chief
Fire-water came to the camp, and
a brave with foolish mind praised Fire-water
more than the sacred totem. He was slain by
Flying Cloud ere the insult was cool on his lips.
But the serpent was angered. He flashed tongue
of fire to the Dacotahs&mdash;called down the rains
and the tempest upon the Peace Camp by night,
until the water spirits rushed through the valley
on white horses, destroying trees and fruits&mdash;washing
the land bare of earth. And, when the
sun came up from his teepee of fire, Flying Cloud
and the best warriors of the Dacotahs had been
carried away by the water spirits and were never
seen again.</p>

<p>"Then there was great wailing in the camp,
and the totem of the tribe was called upon to cease
anger, lest the Dacotahs be a tribe no more.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span></p>

<p>"And the serpent had pity, and spoke thus to
the warriors and braves&mdash;</p>

<p>"'I will stay my anger; but I have given
power to the spirits that ride on white horses,
and I may not call it back again.'</p>

<p>"'Then what shall the Dacotahs do?' asked
the warriors. 'It may be that the spirits will
again ride their white mustangs and take from
us our chief and our young men.'</p>

<p>"And the serpent replied&mdash;</p>

<p>"'When such time come, the Dacotahs will see
two white spirits rise out of the lake that is silver.
When the moon is round, they shall rise out of
the lake that is silver. They shall come without
canoe to bear them, and without arrow or tomahawk
for fighting. By this shall you know them.
Then shall the Dacotahs lay hands upon the
white spirits; they shall treat them kindly, but
they shall bring them to the Peace Camp and
there consume them with fire. Then shall the
power of the water spirits be broken. Then shall
the Dacotahs be safe. Then shall the fire of my
anger be quenched.</p>

<p>"'But I&mdash;the sacred totem of the Dacotahs&mdash;am
mighty and full of pity. The Dacotahs are
brave, but they are not all wise. It may be that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
their ignorance might lead them to bring suffering
to those who are not evil spirits. But let
them not hold back in doubt, for I shall stay
their hand, even though the torch be set at the
wood. For if the eyes of my children are blind,
I shall be near to guide them. And the sign of
this shall be: <i>I shall appear before the eyes of all
people as a serpent of fire</i>. By this shall they
know that they have erred. They shall withhold
the torch, free the captives, and be to them as
brothers.'"</p>

<p>Once more the speaker waited for a space, until
he knew that his hearers had time to grasp the
full meaning of the legend that he had related.
Then he lowered his voice and spoke with deep
meaning that was not difficult for the Englishmen
to understand&mdash;</p>

<p>"Yesterday the moon was round. Two white
spirits came from the lake that is silver without
canoe for sailing, without arms or tomahawk
for fighting. The fiery totem called, and was
answered.... By another sun Mighty Hand
will lead the white spirits of the water to the
camp that is called Peaceful!"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>
<h3>THE TEMPTATION</h3>

<p>It needed no great knowledge of Indian
character and Indian ways to make clear to
the Englishmen all that was implied in this story
that Thunder-maker had recited. Nor had they
any reason to doubt that he had spoken the
truth, for the evident pleasure that it gave him to
watch the effect of his revelation was almost a
sufficiently convincing argument in itself.</p>

<p>Of course Thunder-maker had only the
evidence of his ears to inform him, for the tent
was in darkness, the convenience of lamps not
being a usage of the redskins, who either retire
to sleep at nightfall, or rely upon camp-fires for
illumination. But the Medicine Man could hear
his companions give slight gasps of horror when
the climax was reached. His ears were quick to
interpret the faintest sounds of pleasure, pain, or
surprise.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span></p>

<p>The trio sat in silence for a time, until at last
the soundless night became too oppressive, and
Holden was forced to speak his thoughts.</p>

<p>"Why have you told us of this, Thunder-maker?"
he asked. "Were you sent to us by
Mighty Hand?"</p>

<p>The Indian made an impatient movement of
his body, and grunted meaningly at the question.</p>

<p>"Mighty Hand send Thunder-maker?" he
exclaimed, in an undertone that conveyed a sense
of the uttermost contempt for the chief of the
Dacotahs. "My white brother speak foolish
words&mdash;the words of women and papooses.
Mighty Hand do the wish of Thunder-maker.
The chief of medicine no slave to run when any
man speak."</p>

<p>"Then why have you come to us to-night?"
urged Holden.</p>

<p>"It was not out of friendship for us," added
Arnold.</p>

<p>"Huh! It true what the redmen say, that the
pale-face have heart of buffalo skin that keep out
the love of brother," responded the Indian, in
fawning tones that caused the listeners to feel
as though they would have gladly kicked the
speaker out from the tent. There was low<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
cunning in his voice&mdash;such cringing craft as all
brave men naturally despise. But it was the
instinct of both to draw out the visitor's confidence.
It was possibly their only hope of learning
the truth of their position, thereby enabling them
to make plans for their future actions.</p>

<p>"The redman love the pale-face and would be
friend to him," Thunder-maker went on. "So
he come to tell his brothers what they did not
know. Dacotahs fools, Dacotahs believe foolish
stories, and&mdash;<i>Thunder-maker can lead their feet
by what trail he will</i>."</p>

<p>"H'm. That was plain enough this afternoon
when you played with those rattlesnakes,"
remarked Arnold, at which the Indian laughed
quietly.</p>

<p>"Dacotahs fools. But white men wise. They
see not with the eyes of redmen. But Dacotahs
might be great people if Mighty Hand were in
Happy Hunting-ground."<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>"But what has all this got to do with us?"
asked Holden.</p>

<p>"My white brothers in great danger. In a
few more suns cruel fire burn beautiful bodies.
But&mdash;&mdash;"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well&mdash;but?"</p>

<p>"Thunder-maker could save&mdash;white brothers&mdash;from
fire?"</p>

<p>"Oh, that's it, is it? That's what you are
driving at, you cunning old serpent?" said
Arnold, in accents that were as little complimentary
as the words. "You want us to buy our
lives for money? Well, how much do you wish?"</p>

<p>"My white brothers have papooses, they say
to Mighty Hand?"</p>

<p>"Yes; two boys in a camp by Crane Creek."</p>

<p>"It would gladden the eyes of the pale-faces to
see their papooses by another sun?"</p>

<p>"We would do much to go back to them, for
they must be sad at the absence of their fathers,"
said the elder man.</p>

<p>"Then it may be as the pale-face wish,"
resumed the Medicine Man. "Thunder-maker
can save his white brothers, and he will&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"If you will, there is nothing that we will not
do, within our power, to repay you," said Holden,
wrongly anticipating the motive of the Indian.
"We can give you many dollars, and will give
you blankets and weapons for hunting."</p>

<p>"That is good," returned the redskin quietly.
"But&mdash;Thunder-maker no wish blankets&mdash;dollars,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
He have many&mdash;many." Then he lowered his
voice to speak in deeper tones of confidence.
"Let the pale-face be patient, and listen to the
words of the redman. Then he will understand
how it may be that he look not upon the face of
the fire.</p>

<p>"The Dacotahs foolish. They see white men
as spirits that came out of Silver Waters. And
Mighty Hand foolish too. He believe that fiery
totem speak&mdash;that fiery totem call water spirits to
torture. Foolish redmen! Foolish chief! But
Thunder-maker would see his people a great
people. He would see his tribe wise as the fox
and brave as the great bear. He would see
<i>another</i> chief to rule them&mdash;he would see <i>another</i>
wear the robes of a chief! So he would blind
the eyes of his people. He would say to them:
'Children, you are foolish. The spirits that come
from the Silver Waters are not the spirits that
the totem called. They great spirits sent to you
by Manito to tell you how to be a mighty tribe
again.' Then great medicine will be done, and
Thunder-maker will ask the pale-faces to speak
what Manito has told them.</p>

<p>"Then the pale-faces will tell the Dacotahs:
'Slay Mighty Hand! Let him not see another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
sun, and place the chief's robes on Thunder-maker;
tie the chief's feathers in the hair of
Thunder-maker; write on Thunder-maker's
breast the picture of the sacred totem.' Then
will the Dacotahs believe. Then shall Thunder-maker
be chief of the Dacotahs, and&mdash;the pale-faces
shall return in peace to their tents. I have
spoken."</p>

<p>The Indian paused, but, no comment being
immediately forthcoming, he resumed quickly,
being warmed to excitement by treacherous
hopes&mdash;</p>

<p>"Then it shall be well with my white brothers.
No fire shall have their white bodies&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And if we&mdash;refuse&mdash;to do&mdash;this?" questioned
Arnold slowly and seriously, and his companion
added: "Yes, if we refuse&mdash;what then?"</p>

<p>"The pale-faces will not refuse," returned the
Indian firmly. The savage mind could not conceive
such a possibility as refusal to purchase
freedom at any cost, no matter how despicable
that cost might be. "The pale-faces will not
refuse," he repeated. "The flames hurt much,
and white men die slow, slow as tongue of fire
lick their bodies. The pale-faces not refuse&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But we do!" exclaimed Arnold angrily, as he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
raised his voice to a louder pitch, now that the
first need for caution was past. "You know
little of the pale-faces, as you call them, if you
think that they would do the deeds of dogs to
save themselves from pain. Manito, to us, is
God&mdash;He whom we serve and honour; He
whom we love. Do you think that we could
dare to live another hour if we knew that we had
pretended to be sent by Him&mdash;and so delude
foolish people? No! A thousand times no!
Even if we were to see our sons dying before
our eyes, and knew that one such false word
would save them and us, I tell you, liar and
cheat that you are, that word would never be
spoken! We would be as dumb as the trees of
the forest!"</p>

<p>So moved was Arnold by the indignation that
he felt at Thunder-maker's treacherous proposal
that he rose as he spoke and poured out the
torrent of his anger with reckless vehemence.
Holden also got up, anticipating that the Indian
might attempt some deed of revenge, seeing that
he had displayed his hand to the sight of enemies
who might make much of this knowledge in an
appeal to Mighty Hand.</p>

</div>

<p>But Thunder-maker was too cunning to risk<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
violent measures with two such powerful antagonists.
He merely waited until Arnold had
finished his tirade. Then he suddenly leaped
out from the tent, threw himself upon the ground,
and uttered wild screams that immediately
roused the entire camp.</p>

<p>"Dacotahs! Dacotahs! Come quick to the
help of Thunder-maker! The evil spirits of the
water have witched him! He is burning within
with fire. Quick! quick!"</p>

<p>Instantly the camp was in an uproar, and men
came rushing from all directions, bearing arms
and torches that they had snatched from the
still burning camp-fires. And before the Englishmen
were well aware of the sudden change of
affairs, a score of hands had seized them, and
many strands of thongs bound them helpless,
hand and foot.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>
<h3>A DEATH-TRAP</h3>

<p>"Wake up! Do you want to sleep all
your senses away?"</p>

<p>It seemed but an hour after the tired boys had
laid down their heads that the above words
were bellowed through the opening in the tent.</p>

<p>Bob sat up and rubbed his eyes.</p>

<p>Yes, it was really morning. There was no
doubt about that, for the sun was pouring into
the tent in a warm stream, the birds were filling
the woods with music, and the perfume of
Nature was creeping all around them.</p>

<p>One entire end of the tent had been thrown
open to reveal these delights, and when Arnold
opened his eyes he saw the gigantic figure of
his Scottish host doing its best to fill the space.
There was a good-humoured smile on the man's
face&mdash;a smile that betokened a heart of the
largest dimensions.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span></p>

<p>Bob soon roused his chum, who was buried in
a blanket.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" questioned the latter, as
he unrolled from the coverings.</p>

<p>"Can you not smell it?" demanded Mackintosh.</p>

<p>"Fried bacon and coffee&mdash;yes&mdash;ripping!" was
the reply as Alf began to move, being inspired to
haste by the odour that proceeded from the camp-fire
beyond the tent, where Haggis was busy
cooking.</p>

<p>Mackintosh gave a snort of assumed contempt.</p>

<p>"Bacon and coffee! Who thinks o' bacon and
coffee on a morning like this? Fegs! but have
you no' ears for the birds, nor nostrils for the
scents of Nature? Man, but I'd sooner have a
sniff o' the backwoods&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Than a mouthful of bacon? Not I," chimed
in Alf merrily, at which the man laughed heartily
as he turned on his heel.</p>

<p>"I'm thinking that there's very little poetry in
a hungry stomach," he said. "Well, 'get a gait
on.' You'll find a wash-hand basin behind the
tent, and breakfast'll be ready when you are."</p>

<p>The boys needed no second bidding, and it was
not many minutes before they were ready to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
show how well they could appreciate the half-breed's
culinary art.</p>

<p>While the lads were breakfasting, Mackintosh
and Haggis busied themselves with striking the
tent and packing the rest of the camp outfit
upon the single pack-horse that accompanied
the naturalist's wanderings. The two men had
already fed at an earlier hour, and had stowed
away most of their belongings in preparation for
the journey.</p>

<p>"We'll be making straight for the Silver
Lake, where the hanky was found," explained
Mackintosh as they set off. "Haggis'll maybe
pick up tracks there that'll be o' use to us." And
so a northerly route was taken&mdash;crossing an arm
of the Athabasca, and then following a course
through the woods under the unerring guidance
of the half-breed.</p>

<p>Towards noon the Scotsman called a halt, as
he pointed to a small clearing through which ran
a small stream of clear water.</p>

<p>"This'll no' be a bad place for us to eat our
dinner, lads," he said. "If you'll unpack the
mare and tether her, Haggis, we can see aboot
the fire and the meat."</p>

<p>"Don't you think it would be well if we were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
to shoot something?" suggested Bob. "You
see, we don't know where we may have to go
yet, and game may be scarce. There seemed to
be any amount of it on the way here. It would
be as well to save what we have in hand."</p>

<p>"A good thought," returned Mackintosh
approvingly. "Let's see what the pair o' you
can do wi' your guns while Haggis and I are
setting things to rights."</p>

<p>"I'll go one way and you the other, Bob, and
see which of us will have the best bag in half an
hour!" said Alf, with the eager delight of a
friendly competition in prospect.</p>

<p>"Right you are," agreed Arnold heartily,
"You go to the right; I'll take the left, and in
half an hour we'll meet again at the camp and
compare notes."</p>

<p>With a few words of friendly chaffing as to
which would be the more successful, the chums
parted. Each was determined that his gun
should prove a superior Nimrod's skill, and both
were stirred to high spirits by the excitement of
the quest.</p>

<p>It must not be a matter for surprise that the
boys could take such pleasure in the diversions
of the moment, even recollecting the serious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
nature of the mission on which they had embarked
with the original Skipper Mackintosh.
The truth was that, once having been convinced
that the absent men were indeed alive, the
weight of anxiety was greatly lifted by that
knowledge. As we are already aware, their
fathers were men who had had many a backwoods
adventure in their youth. They were
well capable of taking care of themselves according
to the circumstances in which they were
placed. Hence the chief anxiety now was to
hasten a meeting, when they would learn aright
the cause of the elders' absence; and, though
they could not conjecture what that cause could
be, they felt assured that accident (in the ordinary
sense of the word) was not the reason. Ordinary
accidents of the hunt were not likely to meet two
such experienced sportsmen at one time; and if
one had suffered the other would have found
means to communicate the fact ere this. The
boys felt assured that to some other cause the
matter must be attributed, and so they were
fairly at ease in their minds, though, of course,
anxious to hasten the time when the mystery
would be explained.</p>

<p>Thus it was that when the opportunity occurred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
for this diversion in the form of a little friendly
rivalry, each set off in the highest of spirits.</p>

<p>Holden at once plunged into the thickest part
of the bush at the back of the little camp-ground.
Arnold decided to follow the downward course of
the stream, in the hope that it might lead to a
lake or pool where duck might fall to his lot.</p>

<p>Pushing his way through the scrub that
bordered the running water, Bob went some
distance without any success. Then he heard
the sound of a gun some way to the rear, and
he smiled to himself, as he thought that his chum
had already commenced operations.</p>

<p>Spurred on by the thought, the boy hastened
his steps, and increased his vigilant scrutiny of
the bush for the first signs of game. But luck
did not come his way for some time, and his
anxiety not to be beaten in the contest led his
feet farther than the half-hour's limit merited.</p>

<p>It was not until he had tramped a mile or
more that Bob realised how quickly the time had
passed. It was disappointing to have to return
empty-handed to the camp, especially since he
had heard Alf's gun crack twice again. At the
same time, if there were no creatures to be shot,
he could not be reproached for his lack of success.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span></p>

<p>With a rueful grimace and a laugh of amusement
at his own failure, the boy was just turning
to retrace his steps, when suddenly the bush
rustled at his side, and a brown body leapt into
the air as if it had been shot from a catapult.</p>

<p>"Antelope!" Bob exclaimed with delight,
and quick as a flash of light the butt of his gun
darted to his shoulder and the woods resounded
with the explosion of a cartridge.</p>

<p>It was a quick aim and not too good, for the
animal disappeared in the farther bush, and the
cracking of twigs told the young hunter that
the quarry was yet active.</p>

<p>"This is worth waiting for," said Bob to
himself, as he rushed forward in pursuit. "A
dozen of Alf's prairie chicken will not be equal to
an antelope&mdash;if I get him!"</p>

<p>There was much in that little "if," for evidently
the deer was far from being disabled, since it had
so rapidly made distance between itself and the
hunter.</p>

<p>Nothing daunted, Bob hurried on, replacing
the used cartridge as he ran, and easily following
the tracks that the animal had made in its dash
for liberty.</p>

<p>Bob's pulses were thrilling with excitement,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
but his nerves were the real hunter's nerves that
can be steady even when excitement runs highest.
He gripped his gun firmly, and with eyes scaled
to see each tremor of a leaf he followed the track
with the dogged purpose of one who meant to
capture.</p>

<p>Time and distance were unheeded now. All
the boy's senses were converged towards one aim,
and for the time being he was oblivious to all
other distractions. Suddenly he stopped in the
very midst of a pace, as if he were suddenly
changed into a statue of marble; for at no great
distance, he saw the deer standing at the edge of
what seemed to be a natural paddock of green
grass. The animal had paused in its flight, and
was now sniffing the air with head raised, to discover
if it were still pursued.</p>

<p>It was worth gun-shot.</p>

<p>Cautiously Bob raised his weapon without even
moving from the strained position in which he
had stopped at first glimpse of the game. It
would be useless for him to approach closer,
for the least disturbance of the bush would be
discovered, and a few leaps would carry the deer
across that stretch of green turf, and thence&mdash;probably
beyond all chance of recovery.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span></p>

<p>Bob took a careful sight this time. Then he
fired. Instantly the deer sprang upwards into
the air, gave two marvellous leaps forward, and
then fell in a lifeless heap right in the centre of
the paddock.</p>

<p>Bob gave a cry of exultation and ran forwards
towards his bag. So excited was he now that he
did not notice how the turf shivered under his
feet when first he stepped upon the edge of the
clearing. He had no thoughts for aught else
but the triumph of his stalking. But suddenly,
when he was within a few yards of the deer, he
felt one foot sink beneath him. For a moment
he did not give the incident any serious thought,
but placed his other foot a little beyond, where
the turf seemed firmer. But the next step sunk
deeper than the first, and at each effort to release
the one the other sunk farther.</p>

<p>Then a cold sweat broke out all over the lad's
body. He realised the plight that he was in, for
the green sward was no more than a thin covering
of turf that concealed a great muskeg&mdash;a lake of
liquid mud such as has been known to swallow
men, horses&mdash;nay, even a herd of buffalo, without
leaving a trace of the hapless victims that have
disappeared within that ever-hungry throat.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span></p>

<p>Bob stood still in horror at his terrible discovery.</p>

<p>He looked round him. There was not a sign
of anything that might aid him&mdash;not a log, not so
much as a twig. Nothing was at hand but the
grass that a moment before had looked so fresh
and alluring, but which now seemed to suggest all
that was ugly and treacherous. Even the slain
deer was already beginning to yield to the suction
from beneath.</p>

<p>If ever Bob was near to utter despair, it was
at that moment. He was over the ankles in
mud, and he could feel himself gradually sinking,
while the slimy mass seemed to cling to his limbs
and drag him downwards with irresistible force.</p>

<p>Once he thought that he might be safer if he
lay upon his face, but he quickly banished that
suggestion when he saw that the prostrate
position of the deer did not impede its certain
destruction. He scarce dared to breathe, since
every movement of a muscle hastened the work
of the muskeg.</p>

<p>Down, down he sank. The mud crept to his
knees and gradually began to ascend his thighs.</p>

<p>It seemed to be only a matter of time&mdash;another
hour, perhaps less&mdash;and the tragedy would end.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span></p>

<p>Yet he tried to be brave. He tried to brace
himself to face the trial like a man, though it is
hardly to be wondered at that he felt hope quickly
leaving him, as inch by inch he sunk into that
horrible green death-trap.</p>

<p>Then, just as suddenly as if a voice had spoken
to him from the very grass at his feet, there
flashed into his mind the words that the good old
Scot had spoken by the camp-fire the previous
night&mdash;</p>

<p>"There's a Hand that could guide the frailest
birch-bark through Niagara."</p>

<p>Bob remembered, and hope sprang up in his
heart with a bright-burning flame. Yet his faith
was severely tested, as the mud crept up, up&mdash;now
to his hips, then slowly advancing beyond
his waist, until at last it was embracing his chest
in a cold grip.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>
<h3>TO THE RESCUE!</h3>

<p>As Bob had surmised from the sounds that
reached him, Alf had not been long in
striking luck. Shortly after leaving the camp he
bagged first one chicken and then another, and in
a short time was lucky enough to bring down a
fine jack-rabbit. Then he hastened back to camp,
and arrived there just as he heard the sound of
Bob's gun in the far distance.</p>

<p>"I guess I've done the better of the two," he
said merrily, as he displayed the result of his
half-hour's hunt. "That's the first shot that I've
heard from Bob."</p>

<p>"There's no telling. Maybe your friend
has shot an elephant!" remarked Mackintosh.
"Here, Haggis! Tak' these birds and the
beastie from the laddie, and dress them for the
spit. There's a fine roasting fire, and we'll be
having dinner all ready by the time Maister Bob<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
gets back. I'm thinking that he's come off
second best the day."</p>

<p>"Not much praise to me. If there's nothing
to shoot, a fellow can't get much of a bag, can
he?" remarked Alf generously. He was ready
enough to laugh at his friend in a good-humoured
way. It was quite another matter, however, for
any other person to cast the slightest sneer at his
chum. "I was lucky in finding sport right at
hand. But when it comes to shooting&mdash;a quick
aim on the wing or on the run&mdash;I can't hold a
candle to Arnold. Hark! Did you hear that?
He has brought down two, to balance with my
three."</p>

<p>"Young boys give long trail," remarked the
half-breed, who was pushing wooden skewers
through the birds, preparatory to balancing them
on wooden Y's before the fire.</p>

<p>"Too long," grunted the Scotsman. "We
can't afford to waste time. I was meaning to
start off again soon after dinner."</p>

<p>But by the time the birds were ready for eating,
and the inevitable coffee was hot in the billy-tin,
there were no signs of the boy's return.</p>

<p>Mackintosh was plainly annoyed.</p>

<p>"I dinna like that sort o' going-on," he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
grumbled. "Time is time, and if a body doesn't
keep to time, there's no knowing what deeficulties
may arise."</p>

<p>But Alf knew his friend better than Mackintosh
did. He knew that the excitement of the
chase might result in a little lateness, for no one
is perfect in matters of punctuality (or anything
else, for that matter) under unusual circumstances.
And the lad's anxiety had been gradually increasing
as the delay had been prolonged, though he
said nothing concerning his feelings until the man
offered the remark that rather displeased him.</p>

<p>"I don't think it's quite fair to judge a fellow
until we know all the reasons," he said with keen
resentment. "Bob is not the chap to forget
other people. There's not a bit of selfishness
about him."</p>

<p>"Yet I'm thinking that the silly laddie <i>has</i>
forgotten this time, though, mind you, I'm no'
saying that he's o' a selfish make," returned
Mackintosh a little more gently, seeing how his
previous words had hurt Alf. "I ken fine that
boys will be boys&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And Bob is&mdash;Bob&mdash;one of the best fellows
that ever lived. Listen! What's that?"</p>

<p>The boy had suddenly started and bent forward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
with intent listening, for his quick ear had
caught the sound of two shots fired in rapid
succession. They were very distant sounds, but
still, far away as they were, the clear Western
air enabled them to reach distinctly across the
distance.</p>

<p>"That's Bob's gun! I know its voice!" the
lad exclaimed; and hardly were the words uttered
before two more shots were heard&mdash;equally distant
yet equally clear.</p>

<p>"That's queer&mdash;&mdash;" began Mackintosh thoughtfully,
when Alf interrupted him by springing up
from the ground where he had been sitting, and
exclaiming in troubled excitement&mdash;</p>

<p>"Queer? It means that Bob is in danger.
See! There it is again!"</p>

<p>Two more shots were heard, followed in a
short time by another double.</p>

<p>By this time Mackintosh was thoroughly
roused. His backwoods experience told him
what a chum's sympathy had already gathered,
that no freak of sporting opportunities would
cause these shots to be fired at such regular
intervals. They could mean nothing else but
a signal of distress.</p>

<p>"Come, Haggis!" he said in steady tones that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
showed how ready he was for any emergency.
"Leave those birds, and set your best foot forward.
There's tracking to be done, and that
right quickly."</p>

<p>Picking up his rifle and bidding Alf take his
gun, Mackintosh at once made a move towards
that part of the bush where Bob had last been
seen. Haggis and the dog Bannock quickly
followed, and the former moved with all the
quiet swiftness of a native who was used to meeting
the unexpected emergencies of life without
being in any degree flustered. That life had
many times been in danger, and its safety had
only been attained by being in a constant state
of readiness.</p>

<p>By instinctive acknowledgment of the presence
of a superior craftsman, the two white men yielded
the place of leader to Haggis, who quickly discovered
the tracks that Bob's progress had left
behind. The imprint of a rabbit's foot would not
have escaped notice from such eyes as those of
the half-breed, who had been trained in all forest
lore from his babyhood. Hence it was mere
child's play for him to pick up the track of top-boots,
as well as the traces that had been made by
the displacement of grasses and thorns.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span></p>

<p>Meantime the distant shots were continued at
intervals, until Holden counted twenty in all.</p>

<p>Poor boy! It was little to be wondered at that
he urged Haggis to press on with greater speed,
for now he was certain that his chum must be in
a terrible fix, out from which there was no self-help.
He would hardly waste cartridges so
recklessly were he not in some dire extremity.</p>

<p>"For goodness' sake, hurry!" the boy exclaimed,
for even the rapid walking in Indian file was all
too slow for the patience of one who was pressing
to the rescue of his friend.</p>

<p>But the half-breed did not change the pace.</p>

<p>"We step enough quick for bush-track," he
said, without turning. "We no' wish lose track.
On prairie we go quick&mdash;run; but in bush slow."</p>

<p>"The Haggis is right," completed Mackintosh,
whose position was third in the procession. "It's
no' good to be too quick. We might lose the
trail, and that would mean a vexatious delay to
find it again."</p>

<p>Alf was forced to acknowledge the truth of the
reasoning, though it was a hard task for him to
curb the desire to make a mad dash forward and
take his chance of keeping in the right track.</p>

<p>Then the half-breed stopped for a few moments<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
and bent low to examine the ground and the
surrounding scrub.</p>

<p>"What is it?" questioned Holden. "Have
you lost it?"</p>

<p>Haggis shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"Lost? No. Haggis no' lose track. But he
find others&mdash;deer. White boy shoot deer, but no
kill. Deer jump&mdash;run&mdash;white boy follow quick&mdash;there&mdash;there!"</p>

<p>As he spoke the half-breed rapidly pointed at
the various signs that he had interpreted. They
were plain enough to the native eye, and in a
lesser degree to the sight of the Scotsman. But
Alf's inexperience could only distinguish an
occasional displacement of the undergrowth,
though he was well content to rely on the opinions
of those who were more versed than he in woodcraft.</p>

<p>Again the rescuers hastened onwards, with
Bannock bringing up the rear, and when at last
they came to a part of the bush where the trees
were somewhat fewer, Haggis suddenly stopped
and pointed straight in front of him, exclaiming
the one sound&mdash;</p>

<p>"Ha!"</p>

<p>Holden was at the native's side in an instant.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span></p>

<p>"What is it? Where? What do you see?"
he exclaimed.</p>

<p>"In middle of grass&mdash;see!"</p>

<p>Alf looked, but all that he saw was a head and
shoulders that apparently rested on the grass
without any lower limbs. The poor lad was
indeed in the depth of extremity, and he was
almost faint with exhaustion.</p>

<p>"Bob!" cried Holden in an agony of distress,
and darted for the clearing.</p>

<p>But he had barely crossed a couple of yards
before a pair of strong hands gripped him and
kept him from moving.</p>

<p>"No! No! You dare not&mdash;" said Mackintosh;
but the lad struggled frantically to free himself
from the powerful grip.</p>

<p>"Let me go! Let me go! Can't you see
that Bob is lying hurt?" he cried frantically.</p>

<p>But the hands did not relax their grasp.</p>

<p>"Wait, laddie," said the man's kindly voice.
"Wait, or we'll be having two lives to account
for. Yon's a muskeg&mdash;a living bog. It's death
to them that sets a careless foot on yon green
grass."</p>

<p>Instantly Alf's struggles ceased, and for the
moment he was limp in the arms that supported<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
him. The horror of learning of his friend's plight
struck him dumb and suspended the power to
move.</p>

<p>"Come, come, laddie. You mustn't give in.
Your friend's life depends on your strength."</p>

<p>Mackintosh was a man of the world, whose
experience enabled him to be a good judge of
character. And he well knew the sort of counsel
that would inevitably stir all that was best in the
boy and lend strength to his pluck. He judged
rightly, for immediately Alf straightened himself
with set lips, steady eyes, and controlled nerves.</p>

<p>"Forgive me," he said quietly. "But it
knocked me over to think of Bob&mdash;out there."</p>

<p>"I'm no' blaming you, laddie. But you'll
need all your strength now, for I think that your
friend is past helping himself&mdash;or nearly." Then
Mackintosh faced the muskeg, and called loudly.</p>

<p>"Hullo! Bob! Can you hear me?"</p>

<p>Very slowly the eyelids were seen to open, the
head moved slightly.</p>

<p>"Can you hold out for a bit longer? Can you
get a coat under your arms if I send it to you?"
were the next questions.</p>

<p>The boy did not answer at once. He seemed
dazed, and the man repeated his questions.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span></p>

<p>Then came the answer, spoken weakly and
with an apparent great effort.</p>

<p>"I'll try. But&mdash;come&mdash;quickly&mdash;&mdash;" And the
eyes half closed again.</p>

<p>"That's right. Hold on for a wee bit, and
we'll have you oot o' that mess in a jiffy!"</p>

<p>Without pausing to explain his intentions,
Mackintosh then quickly stripped off his leather
hunting-jacket, emptied the pockets of all that
could weight it, and called Bannock to his
side.</p>

<p>"See, Bannock," he said, "I'm going to tie a
sleeve to your collar&mdash;like this. Now you must
go over there. Do you see? Right over there
where someone needs your help."</p>

<p>He pointed towards Bob as he spoke, and the
intelligent collie looked straight in the direction
indicated. He had often had game pointed out
to him in the same way, so quickly understood
what was wanted of him.</p>

<p>"Off you go!" his master then commanded.
"Off you go&mdash;quick&mdash;quick!"</p>

<p>The dog needed no second bidding. He sprang
forward at once towards the hapless boy, dragging
the coat with him.</p>

<p>"Bannock's coming!" shouted Mackintosh.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
"When he's there, grip the coat and lean on it.
He'll no' move when I bid him stay."</p>

<p>"All right," came the faint reply.</p>

<p>The ground that was so treacherous to the
heavy boots of the incautious hunter could play
no similar tricks with the light tread of the
collie, and in a few seconds he had reached
the goal.</p>

<p>"Lie down!" the great voice rang out, and
the animal immediately crouched close to the boy,
who had just strength enough left to lay hold
of the jacket in such a way that it formed a
slight support of a temporary nature, to check
further sinking for the time.</p>

<p>But how to draw the boy from the slough?
That was the next problem.</p>

<p>Alf turned questioningly to the Scotsman.</p>

<p>"Get to work and break off as many branches
as you can," was the reply to the look. "Haggis,
you've got your tomahawk? Well, cut down a
lot o' these straight poplars. I'll give a hand to
the laddie."</p>

<p>It was not long before the sharp axe had laid
prone a number of young poplars and partly
lopped them, while Mackintosh and Alf had torn
down a number of maple and other leafy branches<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
that would lie fairly flat. These were gathered
to the edge of the muskeg.</p>

<p>"You're no' feared to take a bit o' risk for
your friend's sake?" the man then asked, turning
a look of confidence to the boy.</p>

<p>"Afraid?" echoed Alf contemptuously. "Tell
me what to do, and&mdash;well, I'd give my life for
Bob!"</p>

<p>"That's as it should be," returned Mackintosh
approvingly. "'Greater love hath no man than
this, that a man lay down his life for his friend.'
I would offer to do this myself, only I'm a great
heavy gowk, and Haggis is no' much better. But
you're light as a feather compared with us. Now
we'll put two o' these poles like the sides o' a
ladder; then some o' the branches cross-ways.
And you'll go out and build farther as we hand
them to you. Can you do this?"</p>

<p>"Of course," replied Alf firmly.</p>

<p>"And don't hurry. Work sure and steady.
The turf will stand the weight with only you on
it. And when you reach Bob, you'll spread the
branches all round. The rest I leave to you."</p>

<p>To Alf it seemed hours before even the first
section of the ladder was completed, but he did
his best to control his impatience, knowing well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
the value of Mackintosh's advice; and at last
came the moment of joy when he was ready for
the second poles to project from the ends of the
first ones, and a fresh supply of branches. But
it was a tedious undertaking at the best, made
doubly so by anxiety to reach the end; for each
time the supply of building material was exhausted
he had to creep back for more, as the men dared
not trust their weight far from the edge of the
muskeg.</p>

<p>All this time Bob was watching the work as a
starving man feasts his eyes upon the nearness
of food and drink.</p>

<p>Now and then Alf spoke encouraging words,
but he did not relax his energies, nor did the
sufferer make answer except once, when he stirred
himself to say pluckily&mdash;</p>

<p>"It's&mdash;all&mdash;right, Alf. I can&mdash;hold out&mdash;for&mdash;some
time&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Yet when the younger lad once glanced ahead
of him, the cold sweat broke out over his body,
for he saw that his chum had sunk yet farther,
and that the weight was dragging down the dog
as well.</p>

<p>"I'm coming, Bob! I'll be very soon now!"
the lad forced himself to call cheerily.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span></p>

<p>And, oh! the joy of that moment when at last
the bridge was completed, and Alf could bend
down to grip his exhausted chum beneath the
arms!</p>

<p>"Be careful!" called Mackintosh. "Don't
jerk. Pull steady!"</p>

<p>Inch by inch Alf felt the mud release its hold
upon its prey, as he strained every ounce of
strength to drag his friend from the clammy grip.
It was a tremendous effort, for the boy was slight,
and the hold of the muskeg added weight to
Bob's by no means slender bulk. But at last
Arnold's arms were clear, and in time he was
dragged so far that he could rest his breast upon
the structure.</p>

<p>Then Alf paused for breath. But he did not
delay long. He set his teeth and once more
resumed his task. Then he made the woods
ring with a triumphant "Eureka!" for Bob lay
safe upon the bridge!</p>

<p>Bannock barked for joy also, and struggled up
to scamper back to his master.</p>

<p>"Just in the nick of time! You've saved my
life!" muttered Bob gratefully, when he recovered
a little of his strength after a short rest.</p>

<p>Alf's reply was characteristic.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span></p>

<p>"You'll take a deal of washing, old man, before
you're fit for decent society again!"</p>

<p>The warmth of the sun soon restored some of
the old energy to the chilled body, and after a
time Bob recovered sufficiently to crawl to safety
in the wake of his rescuer.</p>

<p>And when solid land was regained poor old
Mackintosh was fairly crying with joy.</p>

<p>"Lads, lads! but God's been kind to us this
day!" he was saying, while the tears ran down
his manly, weather-beaten cheeks. Then he
made all laugh by suddenly starting with a look
of horror in his face as he exclaimed&mdash;</p>

<p>"Ma conscience! But the birds will be burnt
to cinders by this time!"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>
<h3>CRAFTY TACTICS</h3>

<p>So unexpected had been Thunder-maker's
tactics and so immediate the response of
his people, that the attack was over before the
Englishmen were well aware that it had begun.
Not that any foreknowledge would have availed
them much. They were unarmed, while the
Dacotahs were both armed and numerous. Still,
the average Englishman does not like to be
trussed up without showing some marked resistance.
It makes him feel small to be trapped
without dealing a blow in self-defence.</p>

<p>The place was brilliantly lit with burning
brands which many of the Indians had brought,
and the camp was in an uproar with the voluble
chatter of the men as they crowded round the
captives, while Thunder-maker excitedly cried
out his story of the affair.</p>

<p>So well did the Medicine Man concoct his lies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
so as to work upon the feelings of his people
that meanwhile it seemed as though the
Englishmen were in for a hot time. Indeed,
so great was their wrath that knives were already
reflecting the flames, and fingers were nervously
twitching about the locks of their guns. And
all the time Thunder-maker was dancing about
in a frenzy of passion. He was not brave
enough to strike a blow, but he hoped to shift
the responsibility upon the shoulders of his
brethren.</p>

<p>What would have been the termination of
the scene it is not difficult to decide, had not
the old figure of Swift Arrow pushed a way
through the seething multitude and taken a place
at Arnold's side, while he faced his people with
burning indignation.</p>

<p>"What is this, brothers?" he exclaimed. "Is
this how the Dacotahs treat the stranger in their
tents?"</p>

<p>"They are witches, not men!" came from
many throats, and Thunder-maker added&mdash;</p>

<p>"They call me from teepee&mdash;call me without
words, and fill Thunder-maker with hot fire!"</p>

<p>"Bah!" ejaculated Swift Arrow with utter
contempt, as he turned to the last speaker. "Is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
not Thunder-maker great medicine himself? Has
he no weapon to protect himself from magic?"</p>

<p>But the Medicine Man had his reply ready.</p>

<p>"Thunder-maker sleep. When Thunder-maker
sleep he have no power against magic." Then he
turned to the surrounding Indians with a wild
appeal. "Shall it be, brothers, that the great
medicine of the Dacotahs die before arrows of
the evil spirits?"</p>

<p>"Kawin!<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> Kawin!" was the general reply,
and again the knives glistened as they were
raised in many hands.</p>

<p>Thunder-maker shrieked with triumph.</p>

<p>"Then save our tribe from the magic of the
evil ones!" he cried as he flung his arms upwards
and turned to the captives with a fiendish
grin of exultation.</p>

<p>The Indians were now worked up to a condition
of irresponsible madness. Another such
impulse from the Medicine Man, and the thirsty
knives would be quenched.</p>

<p>"Stay!" commanded Arnold suddenly.</p>

<p>So unexpected was the word from that quarter
that for the time curiosity superseded frenzy, and
all paused to hear what the white man might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
have to say. And Arnold, seeing the advantage,
went on with a calmness that seemed to act like
a spell upon the excited minds. "Stay! My
white brother and I are not afraid to die, if it be
Manito's will that we find the Happy Hunting-ground
this night, and if the Dacotahs have so
forgotten the brave name of their tribe that they
would slay the stranger who came to their tents
in trouble. But first tell me: is it the way of
the redmen to kill a prisoner without the wish of
their chief&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ha!" interrupted Thunder-maker, hissing
the exclamation through his teeth, for even now
he felt his victims slipping through his hands.
"Do not listen, brothers! They are evil spirits&mdash;they
speak magic words against which nothing
prevails. They have forked tongues that dart
as fire. Ugh! I spit upon them&mdash;dogs!"</p>

<p>The Englishmen met the verbal onslaught as
firmly as a rock resists a wave, and Arnold did
not so much as look towards the madman, but
resumed, in the same even tones as before.</p>

<p>"Who are you, redmen? Are you dogs, to
be beaten to obey the first loud voices? Shall
the howling wolf put fear into your hearts, to drag
down a prey that he dares not attack alone?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
Or are you children of your rightful chief? Who
is chief of the Dacotahs&mdash;Thunder-maker or
Mighty Hand?"</p>

<p>"The fiery totem is on the breast of Mighty
Hand," answered one of the warriors. The hubbub
had fallen, and all were listening intently&mdash;partly
with the native courtesy that forbids the
rude interruption of speech, and partly because
the better self was beginning to replace the
moment's frenzy.</p>

<p>"Ah," resumed Arnold with a smile, "I see
that the understanding of the pale-face was wrong.
We thought that the chief was Thunder-maker,
as you hastened to obey <i>his</i> words."</p>

<p>"Thunder-maker great medicine&mdash;&mdash;" began
Swift Arrow, when the former speaker rejoined&mdash;</p>

<p>"Then he would make himself great chief.
Will you braves suffer this insult to the wearer
of the fiery totem?"</p>

<p>"Ka&mdash;Kawin!" was the chorus that met this
question, and the dark looks that had been
directed towards the Englishmen but a little
while since were now turned towards the defeated
Medicine Man, who was standing sullen and
silent.</p>

<p>But Thunder-maker was not yet conquered,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
though he was apparently humbled. To give
him his due, he was a man of wonderful resource,
and when he saw that the tide was turning
against him he was quick to meet the occasion.</p>

<p>"My brothers, listen not to the words of
Thunder-maker," he said quietly, and with a
pretence of sad emotion that he had failed to influence
the other Indians to take the right course.
"Did not Thunder-maker say that these evil
spirits have tongues of magic? Did he not say
that no weapon could prevail against those magic
words? But let it be as my red brothers wish.
Mighty Hand rest in teepee. He not come from
tent at night, unless the war-cry call him. So let
it be as these&mdash;dogs&mdash;say. Let them rest in
their tent to-night, and at another sun we will
bring them before the great chief Mighty Hand,
who is the greatest of warriors, and chief of the
greatest of all tribes, the Dacotahs. I have
spoken."</p>

<p>"And spoken well," said Holden, thinking that
it might be well to propitiate the Medicine Man
for the time. But Thunder-maker, stooping forward
with a pretence of picking up something
from the ground, came close enough to whisper,
so that only the Englishmen could hear him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p>"By another sun, when Mighty Hand looks
upon the pale-faces, it may be that the friends of
Thunder-maker have looked first!"</p>

<p>The words were spoken with all the venom of
a savage threat, and before Holden could make
reply the Medicine Man was speaking loudly to
Swift Arrow.</p>

<p>"The Dacotahs shall see great medicine when
the fiery totem again turn eyes upon the evil
water-spirits. Thunder-maker will now go to
his teepee. He would speak with his little
children that they show much magic."</p>

<p>But Swift Arrow did not deign to reply. He
turned to the Englishmen, and with a few movements
of his hunting-knife severed the cords that
bound them.</p>

<p>"The stranger who has raised no arm against
the redmen may not be bound in the camp of
the Dacotahs. My brothers did wrong. The
pale-faces will forgive my foolish people."</p>

<p>"We do not blame you. You are a good man,
and Manito smiles upon the kind heart," returned
Arnold quietly.</p>

<p>Thoroughly worn out with the events of the
previous day as well as the exciting incidents of
the night, the two friends were glad to be at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
liberty to return to their tent and stretch their
tired limbs upon the robes that had been provided
for them. The Indians had quickly dispersed
at the bidding of old Swift Arrow, and
soon the camp was once more in peace.</p>

<p>Little was said by either of the men as they
lay down at opposite parts of the teepee, and it
was not long before sleep came to the relief of
weariness.</p>

<p>For a couple of hours or more the Englishmen
were wrapt in deep slumber. Then, just as the
grey dawn was beginning to chase the shadows
from the forest, Holden suddenly awoke. It was
not the calm awakening that follows refreshing
rest, but that sudden return of the senses that
one sometimes experiences accompanied by a
horrible instinct of danger.</p>

<p>Holden sat up and looked round. Nothing
strange was to be seen within the tent, and when
he looked through the entrance all seemed peaceful
without. The brown teepees were not even
stirred by a morning breeze. Not a soul was
to be seen, and it was too early even for the
birds to sing their morning anthems.</p>

<p>He looked at Arnold, and saw that his friend
was still enjoying profound rest. So, laughing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
at his own weakness, Holden returned to his
robes and was soon dozing again.</p>

<p>Then a second time he wakened with the
former conviction even stronger than before.</p>

<p>He raised himself on his right elbow, and as he
did so was startled by a sound that is calculated
to strike terror into the hearts of men quicker
than the most formidable of human foes.</p>

<p>It was the danger-signal of a rattlesnake&mdash;the
harsh alarm that is unmistakable even when heard
for the first time, and the sinuous green thing
was poised in the centre of the tent, with head
thrown back in the attitude to strike. It had
been startled by Holden's sudden movement on
awakening, and now was armed to repel its
supposed enemy.</p>

<p>The man dared not move, for the least motion
of a muscle might be sufficient to frighten the
deadly little rope of flesh, and then&mdash;&mdash;?</p>

<p>The continued sound of the rattle had roused
Arnold by this time; but at his first stirring
Holden spoke, though he managed to do so
without moving his lips.</p>

<p>"Keep still. There's a rattlesnake in the tent.
It's got an eye on me, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>But the rest of the sentence was choked, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
the man's blood suddenly ran cold as another
serpent came from among the fur robes, writhing
its cold chill body across his bare hand as it lay
at his side, and then moving towards its companion.</p>

<p>"There's another&mdash;just crawled over my hand,"
whispered Holden hoarsely.</p>

<p>"And I see a third&mdash;over there just beyond
my feet!" said Arnold. "What on earth are
we to do?"</p>

<p>"Lie still. We can do no more, unless we get
a chance to make a bolt for it. But they are
between us and the door."</p>

<p>The men waited in tense silence, preserving
the immovable attitudes of statues until, as time
passed, other serpents made their appearance and
the teepee was swarming with a dozen at least.
They seemed to be everywhere. They crawled
over the robes and peered into the men's faces,
they wriggled beneath the covering and even
passed across Holden's bared throat. But they
were no longer aggressive. They were more of
an exploring than an antagonistic bent.</p>

<p>"I wonder where they have come from and
why they have congregated in this particular
tent?" Arnold questioned in a whisper, and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
with the question, the explanation seemed to flash
into Holden's mind like a flame of fire.</p>

<p>"Thunder-maker!" he exclaimed. "The
treacherous hound! This is his work. I was
wakened by something before. He must have
been letting loose his vile creatures."</p>

<p>Just then the snakes returned unpleasantly
near to the men's heads again, so further conversation
was impossible, for it is remarkable
what little sound will attract a serpent's attention,
and the nature of a rattler is to regard every
sound and movement as something dangerous to
be fought.</p>

<p>For more than an hour the men lay in strained
positions, watching the writhing movements of
the ugly creatures, and wondering how long the
position could be sustained.</p>

<p>And then, just when it seemed that the situation
could not be supported another minute,
they became aware of a sound of soft whistling
at no great distance from the rear of the tent.
At first the sound was quite low, and barely
audible, but gradually it increased in volume
until it took the form of a sort of minor tune of
barbaric rhythm played on some sort of reed
instrument.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span></p>

<p>At the beginning the music was unheeded by
the serpents, but as it became more distinct
it was observable that the creatures became
restless and uneasy. Now and then one would
raise its head and begin to sway gently to and
fro, in agreement with the rhythm. But gradually
each seemed to be irresistibly drawn towards the
back of the tent, as the spell of their master's
music fascinated them. One by one they passed
in one direction&mdash;moving slowly yet steadily in
obedience to the call.</p>

<p>And as the last of the reptiles passed beneath
the edge of the tent-cloth both men sprang from
their couches and rushed round to the teepee
that was pitched a little way behind their own.</p>

<p>But they found Thunder-maker reclining on
a heap of robes and apparently asleep; and not
a sign was seen to suggest the presence of a
"rattler."</p>

<p>So much for the art of the snake-charmer and
the craft of an evil man.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>
<h3>THE PRICE OF A ROBE</h3>

<p>Thunder-maker did not move while
the strangers were watching him. To all
outward appearance he was asleep.</p>

<p>Holden stepped forward and shook the
Medicine Man roughly by the shoulder.</p>

<p>"Come along! Open your eyes, you old
scoundrel. You are no more sleeping than we
are," he said.</p>

<p>The Indian moved, slowly opened his eyes,
and looked for a few moments at the speaker, just
as a person would who had been suddenly roused
from a deep slumber. Then a pleased smile
broke over his face.</p>

<p>"My white brothers in the tent of Thunder-maker?
They are very welcome," he said.</p>

<p>But Holden did not respond to the greeting, as
he demanded&mdash;</p>

<p>"Does Thunder-maker think that we are fools?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
Do you think we did not hear you piping to
those vile serpents of yours?"</p>

<p>The Indian looked puzzled.</p>

<p>"My white brothers speak strange words, or
it may be that the mind of Thunder-maker still
sleeps&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Rot!" interrupted Arnold brusquely. "The
Thunder-maker's mind is wide enough awake.
What is the use of lying to us? We know that
you put those snakes into our teepee, and we
heard you call them back when you found that
your purposes had failed."</p>

<p>For answer, the Indian raised one of the
blankets and disclosed a basket against which he
had been leaning during his pretended sleep.
He raised the lid, looked in, and signed the
Englishmen to do likewise.</p>

<p>"See? On their bed of grass my little
papooses also sleep," he said, lifting the basket
so as to show the tangle of green bodies that it
contained.</p>

<p>"We can gain nothing by further talking,"
remarked Arnold to his companion in an undertone.
"The fellow has done us this time, and
we have nothing to support us if we accuse him
before Mighty Hand."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span></p>

<p>"That's true enough," returned Holden. "He
is best man this time."</p>

<p>The Indian quietly closed the lid and again
covered the basket with a blanket, after which
he looked up with a cunning and triumphant
leer.</p>

<p>"White men will eat; then&mdash;Mighty Hand
take trail for Pleasant Valley!"</p>

<p>How he seemed to gloat over the thought of
the terrible fate that awaited his enemies! Brave
men though they were, they could not but feel a
sense of shrinking at the picture that this man's
attitude and tone conjured up. There are times
when anticipations of pleasure seem to be rendered
more alluring by reason of description. It is also
so with expectancy of pain. Words may paint
that picture in crimson colours so that our revulsion
is intensified before we see it.</p>

<p>"We will gain nothing by remaining here,"
said Arnold abruptly, as he turned from the tent,
whence he was followed by his companion. And
as the Englishmen departed they heard the
Indian saying aloud, purposely to be overheard&mdash;</p>

<p>"The pale-face no' think that he see Pleasant
Valley, but fiery totem call. Fiery totem must
be obeyed."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span></p>

<p>Thunder-maker grinned evilly to himself as he
watched the departure of his visitors. Then he
rose up, folded around him a robe of deerskin that
was covered with many strange designs, and crept
with the sly movements of a prowling wolf among
the various teepees. Reaching the farther side
of the camp, he stopped in front of one of the
tents that stood a little way apart from the others.
Gently he raised the flap and looked in. An
Indian of gigantic size was sitting by himself,
adjusting his leggings and moccasins. He looked
up to observe his visitor, and it was noticeable
that as he did so Thunder-maker winced as
though he were in pain.</p>

<p>There were few who could look upon that
man's face without wincing. In early scalping-days
it had been slashed on one side with a
scalping-knife in such a way that the left eye was
totally destroyed, and a livid scar ran from the
eyebrow to the neck&mdash;drawing the flesh into
creases that robbed that part of the face of any
semblance to humanity. The other side was
whole, but the entire expression was so horrible
that even familiarity did little to prevent repulsion
in the senses of the beholder.</p>

<p>"Thunder-maker is welcome to the tent of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
Red Fox," the Indian remarked, returning again
to the completion of his wardrobe.</p>

<p>"Thunder-maker would speak wise words with
his brother," said the Medicine Man, entering, but
not deigning to sit in the tent of that "brother."
He seldom paid that honour to any teepee except
his own and that of the chief.</p>

<p>"It is well," returned the other man. "Red
Fox will gladly hear the wise words the Thunder-maker
will speak."</p>

<p>The Medicine Man did not waste any time in
needless palaver. The hours were precious to
him, and even an Indian can cut time when his
business is pressing.</p>

<p>"Red Fox is great warrior; Red Fox have
eyes like father of his name," he said. "There
is good work for Red Fox to do."</p>

<p>The listener had broken the cord of a moccasin,
and was apparently concentrating all his attention
on knotting the break. But his attention was
mainly given to Thunder-maker all the same, and
the latter knew it, so he continued&mdash;</p>

<p>"Thunder-maker have rich robe of ermine&mdash;better
robe than Mighty Hand wear. Many
dollars as leaves in tree not buy the robe of
Thunder-maker. Yet&mdash;Red Fox may wear it."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span></p>

<p>"Huh! Red Fox poor. He not have dollars
to buy new traps for hunting."</p>

<p>That was what the Indian said. He pretended
that he thought the Medicine Man had come to
trade. But he knew differently, and waited for
the visitor to "show his hand." Whatever
bargain was to be proposed, he knew that his
share would not be increased by any show of
eagerness to possess the robe that even chiefs had
coveted in vain.</p>

<p>Thunder-maker darted a keen glance at the
other man as he said mockingly&mdash;</p>

<p>"The dollars of Red Fox stay in pouch, yet
ermine robe lie on his shoulders&mdash;if he do what
Thunder-maker say."</p>

<p>Still Red Fox made no sign to show interest,
and the other went on&mdash;</p>

<p>"At Crane Creek two white papooses live in
tent. Red Fox will find them&mdash;he will go as a
friend, and he will say, gentle as the voice of a
mother pigeon: 'White boys would find friends
who are far away? Then Red Fox will lead
them.' And Red Fox will take them by dark
path through the forest&mdash;by long path that twine
like path of serpent. Then, when sun sleep, Red
Fox will creep away&mdash;soft&mdash;soft, that pale-faces<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
hear not. And when sun waken&mdash;Red Fox will
be back at camp of Mighty Hand. I have
spoken."</p>

<p>Red Fox had fastened the moccasin by now,
though he still sat with body bent while he intently
listened to the Medicine Man's proposal to
cause the two boys to be lost in the forest. And
as the story was ended he slowly raised his head
to look into Thunder-maker's face. What he
saw there evidently satisfied him, for his ghastly
face moved with a sort of smile that indicated
satisfaction.</p>

<p>"Then the&mdash;the fiery totem&mdash;foolish?" he
questioned shyly, and the other Indian rejoined
solemnly&mdash;</p>

<p>"The totem of the Dacotahs wise&mdash;very wise.
It speak to Thunder-maker by night, and tell
him this."</p>

<p>Red Fox nodded. But it was not the nod
of agreement with the falsehood so much as at
recognition of the lie.</p>

<p>"Thunder-maker great medicine," he said, with
a slight sneer. "But Red Fox hear much. He
hear water-spirits say to Mighty Hand that they
have papooses. Water-spirits have not young.
So these are pale-faces."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span></p>

<p>Thunder-maker's face flushed angrily.</p>

<p>"Does the Red Fox insult the sacred totem of
the Dacotahs?" he demanded, as he drew himself
up as though it had been he to whom the insult
was offered.</p>

<p>But the Indian also raised himself, and did so
with the conscious knowledge that his gigantic
body and bare limbs, which glistened like muscles
of copper, were more than protection against any
physical attack that the Medicine Man might offer.
And his upper lip curled with a sneer as he
stared straight into the eyes of the totem's
champion.</p>

<p>"Red Fox is not fool. He live long among
white men, and he know that totem cannot speak&mdash;that
totem a lie. But Red Fox will do this
for his brother Thunder-maker. Thunder-maker
would have revenge against the pale-faces in
yonder teepee, for they face Medicine Man&mdash;bravely
when he would have had Dacotahs slay
them. This will Red Fox do, for he would gladly
wear the ermine robe."</p>

<p>"The papooses will never again see their
fathers?" interrupted the Medicine Man eagerly.
He forgot etiquette and totem alike in the excitement
of knowing that the success of one part of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
his evil plans was practically assured. Red Fox
was known to be a man of little conscience though
great determination, and it was only his enormous
strength of arm that allowed him to keep a place
within the clan of the really kindly Dacotahs.</p>

<p>"The Red Fox will blind the trail, that the
white boys never follow? For Mighty Hand
weak&mdash;like woman. He listen to soft words, and
it may be that he will not light fire in Pleasant
Valley. The robe must return to tent of Thunder-maker
if boys find their fathers."</p>

<p>"Let Thunder-maker take his way in peace.
By another sun Red Fox will have found the
young pale-faces; by two suns he will return
to the camp of Mighty Hand&mdash;alone. I have
spoken."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>
<h3>THE BATTLE OF WITS!</h3>

<p>It was only to be expected that Bob was not
fit for much exertion after his experience
with the muskeg, and it was Skipper Mackintosh's
decision on returning to camp that the boy should
proceed no farther that night.</p>

<p>"But that will be a longer time before we get
on the track of our fathers," protested Arnold, to
whom the thought of inactivity for even twelve
hours was irksome.</p>

<p>"Better to bide quiet for a night at present
than be laid up for days later on," was the Scotsman's
response. "But you can set your mind
easy-like. The time will no' be lost, for Haggis
and me will set oot on a wee scouting expedition
to the place where we found yon hanky. We'll
be back by midnight."</p>

<p>This plan was a relief to the boys' minds, for
though it entailed a certain delay in the forward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
journey, the result of the scouting might curtail
matters in the long-run. Mackintosh's report
might enable them to make more definite plans
than were possible at present.</p>

<p>So, after a few preparations for the journey, the
two men set off, accompanied by the faithful
Bannock, early in the afternoon.</p>

<p>"Don't you go and disappear like the others
did!" laughed Holden, to which the "ceevilised"
Haggis replied&mdash;</p>

<p>"Fox lose trail in bush easier than me!"</p>

<p>It was a hot afternoon, so, when the boys had
watched their friends disappear in the forest,
Bob decided that it would be a good opportunity
to wash the mud and slime from his clothes, as
they would soon dry in the sun.</p>

<p>No sooner said than done. The soiled
garments were stripped (for of course the lads
were reduced to one suit apiece) and the stream
utilised as a washing-tub, after which Bob
was obliged to sit in his suit of Nature while
the clothes of Art were drying upon handy
branches.</p>

<p>As we said, the day was hot, and, as the grassy
slope upon which the boys sat formed the margin
of a clear pool where the stream widened, it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
not to be expected that the period of idle ease
would be prolonged.</p>

<p>"Ah!" Bob suddenly exclaimed, as he sat up
and regarded the water with covetous eyes, "the
temptation is too much for me. I'm going to
have a dip."</p>

<p>"It certainly looks more tempting than your
plunge into mud. A pleasant change, I should
say," remarked Alf chaffingly. Then he added
merrily: "But are you sure that you can stand
it? It won't do to exert yourself too much yet.
Old Mackintosh expects you to rest."</p>

<p>"That's all right. I shan't muck about very
much. I can take it easy. As a matter of fact,
I am sure that a plunge will buck me up."</p>

<p>"All serene," returned the younger boy, rising
to prepare himself for a bathe. "So long as
you don't think that it will do you any harm,
I'm ready."</p>

<p>A short run, and then Bob had entered the
water in the clean-cut style of a practised diver.</p>

<p>"It's glorious!" he called to his chum, who
was almost ready to follow his leader. "I should
think that it is quite eight feet in the middle, so
you can plunge safely."</p>

<p>"Right. Clear out of the way!" was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
response, and in a second more Holden in his
turn cleft the sparkling water.</p>

<p>Those of our readers who are only familiar
with the cheerless sea or even the placid river-bathing
of England can have no idea of the
charm that is found in emulating the fishes in
the cool depths of a Western forest stream.</p>

<p>Imagine the great trunks of cedar and pine
and the gnarled giants of maples spreading their
great arms&mdash;shutting off the distance with a
surrounding barrier of dense colour; imagine the
red willows dipping their heads in the margin
of the bowl, gaily coloured birds skimming the
surface in pursuit of insects, and gaudy butterflies
sometimes touching your cheek, like a piece of
down borne upon the mellow air. At such a
time, in such a place, you feel yourself to be
but a tiny little speck in the centre of the world
of Nature. You feel as free as a savage. If
you are not happy, it must be that you are a
weakling boy who lacks the real boy's love for
out-of-door freedom.</p>

<p>These were some of the sensations that our
young heroes experienced as they splashed about
in the crystal pool. Probably they did not realise
the details as I have described them; but that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
was the effect, all the same. It is the glorious
sense of freedom that everybody feels if they
have the "backwoods spirit." It cannot be
properly described, but I can smell the atmosphere
of it all, even though I am now sitting in
an English room in an English county. And so
intent were the boys on the enjoyment of the
moment that they did not observe the figure of
an Indian who crept out of the bush near by
while they were experimenting in various positions
for swimming.</p>

<p>The Indian paused for a few moments. Then,
seeing the attention of the lads was devoted to
their amusement, he crept to the tent like a snake
in the long grass. This he examined thoroughly,
and he gave a grunt of satisfaction as he discovered
the pack-horse picketed near by. After
this, seeing no necessity for further secrecy of
movement, he boldly walked to the edge of the
pool where the boys were bathing, and sat down
quietly to watch their play.</p>

<p>It was Alf who was the first to discover the
stranger. "I say! There's an Indian!" he
exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Where?" questioned Bob, who had swum a
little way out of sight beyond a curve in the creek.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span></p>

<p>"Over there&mdash;beside our clothes. But, I say,
what a horrible face he has got! He looks as
if a lion had started to chew him and changed his
mind! He's the ugliest-looking freak I ever saw."</p>

<p>Taking for granted that the Indian would not
understand the uncomplimentary remarks, Holden
swam towards the side of the pool, being quickly
followed by his chum. But the Indian had
understood. He was as familiar with colloquial
English as he was with his own tongue. Nevertheless,
he did not alter the grin on his face,
though there was something very different from
a grin at his heart&mdash;a something which (if the
rash speaker had only known it) had suddenly
determined him to carry out his contract in quite
a different manner from that which had been
arranged with Thunder-maker.</p>

<p>An Indian is a queer creature at the best. He
loves as quickly and impulsively as he hates,
while devotion may be turned into detestation as
rapidly as a vessel of clear water is discoloured
by a drop of ink. Red Fox's eyes flashed fire
towards the imprudent lad, though his lips still
smiled, and anyone who was a judge of Indian
character would have understood from that look
that it would be an ill moment for Alf if ever it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
was within the power of the redskin to repay the
insulting expressions.</p>

<p>By this time both lads had reached the shore,
whereupon Bob addressed the stranger while the
pair proceeded to dress&mdash;Arnold's clothes being
dry by this time.</p>

<p>"Well, where have you come from?" the boy
questioned.</p>

<p>"Trail long. Red Fox come over prairie&mdash;bush&mdash;far&mdash;far&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, you understand English?" exclaimed Alf,
at the same time hoping that the Indian had not
heard enough, or understood English well enough,
to comprehend the recent criticisms as to his
personal appearance.</p>

<p>The redskin nodded, though he craftily pretended
that his knowledge of the foreign tongue
was but scanty.</p>

<p>"Red Fox know little&mdash;very little. He speak&mdash;he
no' understand all that ears tell him."</p>

<p>"And a jolly good job, too," commented Alf
to his friend. "He's a hideous monster, but I
shouldn't like to hurt his feelings by letting him
know my opinion."</p>

<p>"I don't think that I would express it too
freely, if I were you," said Bob, who had quickly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
resumed his everyday attire. "You never can
tell how much fellows like that understand. I
remember father telling me that Indians won't
always admit that they know English well.
They think that they can drive better bargains
by pretending ignorance."</p>

<p>Then the boy turned to the native, and the
fact that the man was alone and seemed to have
no other possessions than his gun, hunting-knife,
and pipe, raised doubts in the lad's mind as to
the truth of the statement concerning the long
journey. He knew and had heard sufficient
about Indians to be aware that they seldom
travelled any distance without their family and
other belongings.</p>

<p>"You said that you had come a long trail?"
he said, regarding the Indian with a sharp scrutiny.</p>

<p>Red Fox bowed assent, taking out his pipe to
fill it with kini-ka-nik (tobacco and red willow
bark mixed) as he spoke.</p>

<p>"Red Fox come far&mdash;with feet of deer. He
have story for ear of pale-face brothers."</p>

<p>The boys started at the remark, while Alf repeated&mdash;</p>

<p>"A story?"</p>

<p>"From the white men to their papooses."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span></p>

<p>This was news indeed; but the unexpected
announcement disarmed suspicion for the moment.</p>

<p>"From our fathers?" said Bob eagerly.
"Where are they? What has kept them from
returning to camp?"</p>

<p>"The white men rest," replied the Indian.
"The trail far. They find Red Fox, and they
say: 'Go, find our papooses and lead them by
straight trail to our tent.'"</p>

<p>"But they had no tent with them!" exclaimed
Alf, at once touching the weak point in the falsehood.
"Perhaps they are with other Indians?"</p>

<p>Red Fox had not been instructed by Thunder-maker
in the details of the story that he was to
tell in order to gain his ends. It had not occurred
to him to invent more than that he had been sent
to bring the lads. That had seemed sufficient to
attain his aims, though he realised that it would
not do to say that the white men were captives.
That might frighten the boys and prevent their
following his guidance. The poor servant had
not calculated upon the probing questions that
would have been naturally anticipated by an
English mind and prepared for.</p>

<p>But he saw the blunder, and hastened to amend
the error as best he might.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span></p>

<p>"White men with Indians&mdash;with friends. Red
men good to pale-faces&mdash;give them food and
teepees and robes to rest on. So white men
wish papooses to follow where Red Fox walk."</p>

<p>Holden turned aside to his chum.</p>

<p>"I'll be hanged if I'll follow the lead of a
murderous-looking villain like that unless he can
show very good reasons why I should. His face
is like a nightmare."</p>

<p>"I can't say I like the look of him myself,"
returned Bob. "He hasn't got the expression
of a fellow you could trust. Besides, don't you
think that if our fathers were well and had sent
a native messenger to us&mdash;don't you think that
they would have sent some sort of written message
as well?"</p>

<p>"It would have been easy enough. Father
always carries his notebook and pencil with
him&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"So he could have easily explained matters.
I don't think he would have trusted an Indian
to be understood. It isn't as if we knew anything
of the lingo."</p>

<p>While the boys were thus discussing the situation
in low tones, they did not heed how Red
Fox was observing them sharply from the corners<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
of his eyes. He was trying to discover how far
his deception had succeeded, though he endeavoured
to hide his anxious observation by
the action of lighting his redstone pipe. And it
must be confessed that his keen scrutiny of the
lads' faces did not reassure him. He could see
suspicion plainly marked in both, while his heart
burned with fire of anger, though resentment was
mainly directed to the younger lad, whose inadvertent
remarks had cut so deeply into the
savage pride.</p>

<p>But the redskin's mental observations were
suddenly cut short by Bob, who wheeled upon
him with a sudden inspiration.</p>

<p>"Look here," he said quickly, though his voice
was pleasant and almost reassuring, "it is very
good of you to travel so far to bring us this
news. We are glad to see you, and will try to
give you a good present. But we will settle our
business first. So, give me the letter, and then
we will go to the tent and eat."</p>

<p>"Letter?"</p>

<p>The Indian repeated the single word in a
puzzled tone.</p>

<p>"Yes; the one my father gave you," said Bob.</p>

<p>So mystified was Red Fox by the intelligence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
that apparently he had not only been expected
by the boys but that he had been looked for as
the bearer of a letter from the fathers to their
sons, that he was momentarily startled out of
his caution in pretending an only slight acquaintance
with the English language.</p>

<p>He stared open-eyed at the question, and Bob
continued evenly&mdash;</p>

<p>"Of course my father would send a letter if he
wanted us. He would do that to prove that his
messenger was one whom we could trust. Did he
give you one?"</p>

<p>Red Fox was quite taken off his guard by the
white boy's guile, but he strove to cover his confusion
by further lying.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;the white man send paper by hand of
Red Fox, but&mdash;but Red Fox foolish; he&mdash;lose
letter&mdash;on trail&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But you are <i>sure</i> you had one? It would be
written&mdash;in red&mdash;with a red pencil&mdash;a red paint-stick."</p>

<p>"My white brother speaks true," said the
Indian.</p>

<p>"Of course he does!" chimed in Alf, to whom
his chum's ruse was now clear. "And if that
letter was written in red and sent to us, we would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
know where it came from, and would follow the
messenger at once."</p>

<p>The Indian flashed a quick glance of hatred
towards the last speaker, but instantly lowered
his eyelids again, as he returned with more calmness
than before&mdash;</p>

<p>"It is well. The pale-face did paint letter
with red. But&mdash;Red Fox foolish Indian. He
lose letter on trail. He seek much&mdash;much&mdash;but
no' find."</p>

<p>The game of bluff had succeeded. Now the
boys knew for certain that the man was lying&mdash;that
he had not been commissioned by either of
their parents, and both laughed derisively.</p>

<p>"Trapped!" exclaimed Holden triumphantly.
"You've got him tight as a rabbit in a gin,
Bob."</p>

<p>How that sneering laughter scorched the redman's
pride! It touched him at the quick, and
caused him to writhe inwardly, until his fingers
twitched beneath the folds of his blanket with
eagerness to tear out the tongue that thus jeered
at him. Yet the lads did not dream how near
they were to tragedy as they laughed at the
little comedy, with the chief actor sitting huddled
at their feet. They did not notice how the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
Indian's eyes first measured the distance from
the overhanging bank to the surface of the
water, and then as quietly calculated the distance
between himself and the lads.</p>

<p>"Yes, you were indeed foolish," resumed
Arnold, "for you have shown us that your words
were lies. My father never wrote such a letter,
I am sure, for a red pencil is not a thing that he
possesses. And if he were well enough to write,
he would be well enough to come himself, instead
of sending such a foolish Indian and a bad
liar."</p>

<p>"At the same time," whispered Alf, "the chap
must know something, or he wouldn't be here
at all. We must find out that in some way or
other."</p>

<p>"True," Bob said.</p>

<p>But there was no time allowed for considering
what means to adopt to obtain further information,
for just at that moment Red Fox uttered a
wild cry, and sprang from the ground with the
leap of a deer. Next instant Bob was gripped
as in a vice and flung into the centre of the
pool; then, with a snarl like that of a wild cat,
the Indian sprang for Alf's throat.</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>
<h3>OFF!</h3>

<p>The Indian is nothing if he is not unexpected
in all his actions. Surprise attacks
were ever his weapons of warfare. From among
the long grass of an apparently innocent meadow
he would suddenly rise up with his followers to
attack the caravan that was quietly pursuing its
way along the prairie in absolute ignorance of
the nearness of enemies. In the dead hour of
night the war-whoop would suddenly ring through
the forest, and the settlers would be scalped and
dead before the last echo had time to fade
away.</p>

<p>So it was on this occasion. Utterly unsuspicious
of attack, both boys were taken at a
disadvantage. Bob was floundering in the water
before he had time to realise the assault, while
Alf was equally unprepared as the Indian sprang
towards him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span></p>

<p>The claw-like fingers missed their intended
grip upon the boy's throat, but the arms managed
to grapple the lad in a tight embrace. Alf
struggled well, but he was no match for the
muscles of the giant Dacotah.</p>

<p>"I'm coming! I'll be with you in a second!"
called Bob from the water, striking out strongly
for the shore as soon as he had recovered
breath.</p>

<p>The Indian looked hastily around him without
releasing the bearlike hug. He saw the swimmer
quickly approaching, and he gave a cry of fury
as he thought that he would be baulked of his
purpose of revenge, for he rightly thought that
he would stand a poor chance against two active
lads. He might succeed in injuring the one,
but there was little chance of his escaping.</p>

<p>Suddenly he released Alf. Feeling himself
free for the moment, the boy jumped back in
readiness for another attack. But once again
the unexpected had him at a vantage. The boy
anticipated no other attack now but that of fists
or a knife at the utmost. These were the only
contingencies that his inexperience could imagine.
But before he had time to conjecture other
possibilities, Red Fox had slipped off his blanket,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
flung it around the lad just as the ancient
gladiator was wont to entangle his opponent in
the deadly net, and before Arnold had reached
the river bank the Indian had wound the blanket
tightly round his captive, picked him up in his
arms, and commenced running towards the tent.</p>

<p>Bob gave a cry of dismay and rushed on in
pursuit.</p>

<p>But the redskin had the start, and ran straight
towards the picketed horse, still carrying the lad,
who was half stifled by the thick cloak, and
practically helpless, owing to the tightness with
which the bond was twined.</p>

<p>It would have been an easy matter then for
Red Fox to have killed his captive and yet
escape the other boy. But that was not his
purpose. In his thirst to revenge the insult of
Alf's words, he had quite forgotten Thunder-maker's
commission and the coveted ermine robe.
These were nothing to him now. He had
listened to sneers with patience. The time had
now come to repay the taunts with interest. He
ran towards the pack-horse. A slash with his
hunting-knife severed the rope within two or
three feet of the halter. Alf was then thrown
roughly across the animal's back, while the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
Indian was himself astride an instant afterwards.
A vicious dig of the heels, and the horse sprang
forward.</p>

<p>And the last that Bob saw as he reached the
tent was an ugly face grinning at him and an
arm waving tauntingly as horse, rider, and
burden disappeared into the woods.</p>

<p>Arnold was aghast!</p>

<p>He rushed into the tent and snatched up his
repeating rifle, which was already loaded; by the
time he emerged again he could only hear the
distant sound of the fugitive rider pressing
the branches through the bush track.</p>

<p>He ran forwards at top speed, but he knew
well that unless some accident befell the horse
he stood a poor chance of being able to aid his
chum. The Indian would know the bush as well
as his namesake fox. He would not be likely to
take any risk that would imperil his safety or
blight any evil purpose that he might harbour.</p>

<p>The boy followed the track, which was well
marked. It was the same course that had been
taken by Mackintosh and Haggis earlier in the
day. For a time it led through an avenue of
trees. Then it branched off to the left, where
the ground was hard-packed and dry, having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
been stripped of vegetation by a bush fire earlier
in the year. Here the tracks were less easy to
follow, for a steady breeze was blowing, and the
imprints of the hoofs were covered almost as
quickly as they were made.</p>

<p>It was heart-breaking to have to slacken speed
at such a time, when every second might mean
disaster to his chum. But what else could he
do? And when ultimately the tracks led him
to the border of a vast marshland, the lad was
obliged to halt in what was almost despair.</p>

<p>"What is to be done now?" he exclaimed to
himself. "Poor old Alf! What a fool I was not
to be prepared for such a rascal, when once my
suspicions were so roused!"</p>

<p>But it was no use sitting down in hopelessness.
Such weakness would have nothing to gain and
everything to lose. So Bob pulled himself together,
as the apt saying has it, and racked his
brains to meet the occasion.</p>

<p>Not a sound could he now hear to indicate
which way the fugitive had taken. Moreover,
the tracks completely disappeared from sight
when the boy had taken a few paces into the
shallow water and spongy moss.</p>

<p>Plainly the only course was to mark a starting-point<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
with a stake, and then follow round the
margin of the swamp until he discovered the spot
where the rider had crossed.</p>

<p>It was a tedious process, but apparently there
was no option. So he resumed the weary tour
with such hope as he could summon.</p>

<p>Arnold found the tracks after more than two
hours' patient searching, as the dusk was beginning
to creep over the forest. The footprints
were more distinct now than they had been at the
other side of the marsh, so the boy was able to
make some rapid progress. But, as the darkness
fell the work became more difficult. He had
to stoop low in order to see the tracks at all, and
ultimately he could only follow them on hands
and knees&mdash;feeling the footprints with his fingers,
just as a blind man feels the letters in his book.</p>

<p>He was becoming thoroughly exhausted. Still
he plodded on with dogged perseverance. His
knees were grazed and his back was aching,
especially where the rifle was strapped; and at
times he even stumbled and fell in a heap, from
which each time he found it more difficult to rise
than on the former occasion.</p>

<p>It was indeed a trial that would have taxed
the strength and nerves of the strongest. When<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
we remember what the boy had already undergone
that day, we have reason to wonder that he
endured so long. Still he persevered. Inch by
inch he felt his path in the pitch darkness, crawling
through the bush with only hooting owls and
whining wolves for company, until at last, worn
out and dizzy, his muscles gave way, and he
floundered unconscious upon the earth.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>
<h3>A NIGHT'S TERROR</h3>

<p>When Bob reopened his eyes, it was
to awake suddenly with the horrible
feeling that he was being watched by some
hidden foe.</p>

<p>He started, and as he did so he was conscious
of the sound of many pattering feet&mdash;soft, muffled
sounds, yet loud enough for him to hear. He
even thought, as he turned over and flung out
his arm, that his hand had touched something
that was warm and furry.</p>

<p>He sat up and gripped his rifle as he stared
around him.</p>

<p>In the semi-darkness of the rising moon he
could see dark figures moving restlessly all
around him, while a score or more of eyes kept
twinkling like stars to indicate how he was being
watched.</p>

<p>Just then a wild, long-drawn wail rent the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
night air beside him. The boy's blood seemed
to run cold at the sound, for he knew that he
was surrounded by a horde of timber wolves who
had thought him dead, and come too soon.</p>

<p>Too soon? Yes. But how long would their
moment be delayed?</p>

<p>Bob staggered to his feet and held his rifle in
readiness. But the ghouls of the night kept at
some distance, though he could still see them
stirring here and there, as if they were discussing
plans among themselves.</p>

<p>The boy waited&mdash;it seemed hours&mdash;each
moment expecting a dash from the black
spectres. Still they hung back, until Bob
actually began to long for the attack to begin,
that the strain of waiting might be broken.</p>

<p>Then something moved behind him. He
wheeled about and swung his rifle like a club,
at random. The butt met a soft substance, and
a wild howl followed, as a wolf that had been
creeping upon him from the rear now sprang
back among his lurking comrades. Instantly the
forest rang with wails and howls and snarling, as
the wolves sprang upon their wounded comrade
(as is the way of many wild animals) and tore
him to pieces.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span></p>

<p>Yet Arnold dared not leave the spot. If he
ran, the wolves would soon be upon him, for a
fleeing prey is more closely pressed than one that
stands at bay. Moreover, he was in the centre
of a clearing. If he were to enter the woods,
there would be many quarters from which he
would be open to attack and unable to defend
himself freely.</p>

<p>The night wore on, and the moon crept up
into the arc of the sky. His enemies could be
plainly seen now, though the shadows prevented
him from determining how great was their
number. Probably the uncertain light deceived
him and multiplied the actual score. One thing&mdash;they
were in sufficient numbers to be a formidable
danger, and it would need sharp watching to
ward off the attack effectively.</p>

<p>So long as there was a remnant of their comrade's
flesh to fight and snarl over, Bob was left
in peace. But presently the strife became less
and the noise sank, and by such signs he knew
that he had again become the object of their
unwelcome attentions.</p>

<p>He stood his guard with every nerve strained
to catch the first sight and sound of danger.</p>

<p>Then he saw two large forms creeping towards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
him from the front. They came slowly, creeping
low like dogs stalking game in the grass.</p>

<p>Bob waited until they drew near. He was
reluctant to exhaust a cartridge unless it was an
absolute necessity. His wish was to exercise the
force of his muscle on these as he had done with
their predecessor.</p>

<p>But, as the wolves came within a few yards,
they stopped and eyed him cautiously, and in this
position the furred enemies and the boy stood
watching each other, just as wrestlers watch each
other's eyes to discover the vantage moment for
a deadly grip.</p>

<p>The time passed, yet neither side moved.
Then, to Bob's dismay, he discovered that the
whole mass of wolves had gathered together, and
were slowly creeping upon him in the wake of
these two leaders.</p>

<p>And with the knowledge, the boy seemed to
go mad for the time. He could delay the fight
no longer. His blood rushed hot to his head.
He fired one shot at the foremost wolves. Then
he gripped his weapon by the muzzle and sprang
straight for the pack.</p>

<p>"Come on, you brutes!" he yelled, as he laid
about him right and left. "If it's got to be a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
fight, the sooner we begin, the sooner it'll be
over!"</p>

<p>Wild with passion, the boy fought with the
false strength that is always the accompaniment
of delirium. As the blows told, the wolves
howled and shrieked and leapt for him with a rage
that was equally frantic to his. Fortunately they
kept to one side&mdash;that was the side from which
the moon shone. They could see him plainer thus.
Otherwise the light would be in their eyes, and he
but a black figure that they could not understand.</p>

<p>How he fought that night!</p>

<p>Strange to say, all fatigue had left the lad's
body. He had the endurance of three normal
boys&mdash;at least it seemed thus, though we never
know our real strength, muscular or mental, until
we are in the straits of desperation.</p>

<p>More than once he received a nasty little snap
in the arm. But these were unnoticed in the
heat of the combat. His eyes were "seeing red,"
as the Westerners say. He had no nerves to
feel with; only muscles to fight with. And all
the time the impromptu club was in action&mdash;sometimes
swinging like a flail, at other times
being gripped for a no less effective thrust with
the butt.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span></p>

<p>But gradually the attack became perceptibly
easier, as the wolves were beaten back or slain
by the ceaseless swing of the rifle. Bob recognised
the weakening of the assault, and the spirit
of the conqueror fired his blood to renewed
energy.</p>

<p>Baulked of his prey, a great timber dog sprang
forward with determination to vindicate the
honour of his kind.</p>

<p>Crash went the weapon, a single howl escaped
from the savage creature, then he fell back,
quivering and lifeless, upon the ground.</p>

<p>That was the end of the conflict. Their last
leader slain, the others turned tail and fled.</p>

<p>Arnold stood firm on the defensive. His hair
was soaked in sweat, his clothes were torn in
many places, and he could feel the sharp sting of
a wound in his shoulder. It was some time
before he could believe that the fight was indeed
over. The change from storm to calm had been
sudden; and it was only when he understood
that strength was no longer needed that he
began to feel the evidences of fatigue. His
limbs began to tremble with the reaction as the
unnatural strength that had buoyed him so well
now commenced to ebb. He looked around him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
The signs of his conquest were visible in the
moonlight as dark lumps lying here and there.
Then his keen eyes began to haze and his head
to swim. And for the second time that night he
sank to the ground in a state of unconscious
fatigue.</p>

<p>It was bright daylight when Bob regained
his normal faculties. The morning had considerably
advanced while he had lain oblivious
to the passage of time.</p>

<p>The boy sat up. He was stiff and sore. But
he was no puny schoolboy. He had a sturdy
frame that healthy athletics had trained to meet
fatigue without injury, and Nature's needed rest
had rapidly restored normal strength, though, as
we said, his muscles were not free from certain
little aches to remind him of late events.</p>

<p>At first his thought was that the previous
adventure had been nothing more than a
bad dream. But as his eyes scanned the surroundings,
and he saw no fewer than seven
carcases of timber wolves lying unpleasantly close
to him, he was quickly convinced that there had
been no ill vision but terrible reality.</p>

<p>Next he called to mind the quest on which
he had started from the camp.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span></p>

<p>That thought was sufficient to banish the last
sensation of drowsiness, and he immediately rose
up and examined his rifle, to see if it had
suffered from the adventure. The weapon had
stood the test well. Beyond a few dents on
the butt (which would be so many trophies of
the combat) it was otherwise uninjured. The
scratches on his own flesh were not serious,
though they nipped a little at first movement.
So, altogether, Bob was satisfied that he had
come through the ordeal in a manner that demanded
thankfulness to a protecting Providence.</p>

<p>The next move was towards the bush, where
the Saskatoon berries were hanging in inviting
clusters like myriad bunches of purple grapes
in miniature. These, together with a draught
from an adjacent spring, had to suffice for
breakfast. Then he turned once more to take
up the tracks that he had been forced to forego
on the previous night.</p>

<p>It was not long before the boy rediscovered
the trail, and with a thousand misgivings for
the unavoidable delay in going to his chum's
assistance he started on the track at a rapid
pace.</p>

<p>It was a winding path that he followed; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
in order to ride swiftly Red Fox had been
obliged to keep more or less to the open way
through the woods, relying upon speed more
than strategy to outreach pursuit. He had a
plan in his mind that he meant to carry
out when at a safe distance. After that
was accomplished, he did not care how soon
the searchers might reach the spot. He would
be far away. And the boy&mdash;well, they would
be welcome to find him then.</p>

<p>Doggedly determined to find his chum at all
costs, Bob pressed on, seldom taking his eyes
from the ground, where the imprints showed
how heavy hoofs had thrashed the trail.</p>

<p>What had happened to his chum? Had the
savage merely stolen him for some wild purpose&mdash;perhaps
to await a ransom? Or could the
worst have happened, and Alf be even now&mdash;&mdash; No,
no. Bob could not bear that thought, and
he put it from him, struggling manfully to retain
hope as well as strength.</p>

<p>And then suddenly&mdash;when it was about noon&mdash;he
came upon the Scotsman's pack-horse quietly
grazing beneath the trees, and at a little distance
Alf sitting on the ground with Red Fox prostrate,
resting his head on the lad's lap.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>
<h3>THE FATE OF RED FOX</h3>

<p>It may seem a little surprising that Alf did
not make a better resistance when he found
himself being carried away on horseback. It is
no easy matter for even an Indian to carry a
person lying in front of him on a bare-backed
broncho when the person is helpless and still. It
is a yet less easy matter&mdash;if not an impossibility&mdash;to
do the same thing with a struggling captive.</p>

<p>Of course we know that Holden was at a
disadvantage. He was powerless to use his
arms, which were held close to his sides by the
wrappings, and it was with difficulty that he
breathed. But his legs were comparatively free,
and it would not have required much energy to
make such resistance as would have considerably
hampered Red Fox in his purpose.</p>

<p>The reason for the lad's passive demeanour is
not difficult to understand.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span></p>

<p>Alf was no fool. Indeed, he possessed a more
than usual degree of common sense, together
with a gift for rapid reasoning. He quickly
decided that, for the time being at least, he was
at the Indian's mercy. His instinct told him
that, for some unknown reason, he must have
incurred the native's wrath; and, even though
he might have struggled with a measure of
success, the Indian was both powerful and passionate
enough to murder him then and there.</p>

<p>No person, even in the direst straits, is anxious
to incur a violent death. Holden was no
exception to that rule, so he deemed it best to
make pretence of fainting, on the chance that
time might release him from his plight. It
would only be a needless exhaustion to struggle
now, when he would be easily overpowered.
Moreover, a show of resistance might mean the
sudden plunge of a hunting-knife.</p>

<p>So he lay still, and the Indian laughed aloud,
believing the lad to be unconscious through
fright.</p>

<p>"Huh! White dog laugh at Red Fox? He
say Red Fox face hideous?" the redskin exclaimed
jeeringly, as he pressed the horse to the
race. "'Tis well. Red Fox face bad&mdash;very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
bad; but white boy worse when Indian hand
have used knife!"</p>

<p>Then the boy understood the mystery. His
careless words <i>had</i> been understood, as Bob
had suggested. And his fate was to be
vengeance of a like mutilation of his own fair
cheeks!</p>

<p>Not if he knew it!</p>

<p>It was little wonder if the lad felt his blood
run cold as he listened to the Indian's vaunt,
and it is little wonder that his head swam until
he was near in reality to the very faintness that
he had assumed.</p>

<p>But real pluck is never subdued for long.
The very threat was enough to rouse a strong
determination to thwart the brutal intention, and
his mental decision was that which we have just
recorded in the third person: "Not if I know it!"</p>

<p>Red Fox had quite forgotten about the ermine
robe. That was quite Indian-like. The object
of the moment was all that he cared about. To
gain that aim he would have sacrificed a
thousand robes of costliest fur&mdash;nay, even life
itself, if he could have the satisfaction of vengeance
first.</p>

<p>Guiding the broncho by the swaying of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
body and the occasional use of a halter-rope,
the redskin did not permit the animal to slacken
speed for an instant.</p>

<p>Once, owing to the stillness of his burden, he
drew aside a portion of the blanket to look at
the boy's face.</p>

<p>He saw that the eyes were closed, and a fear
came into his heart that perhaps he was to be
robbed of his pleasure after all.</p>

<p>But the lips trembled, and, on bending down
the Indian could hear the sound of breathing.</p>

<p>"Huh!" he laughed, as he replaced the cloth.
"That good! Pale-face&mdash;he sleep, but he wake
soon when Red Fox make sign of totem. Then
white boy laugh not again at Indian. Red Fox,
he laugh at hideous white boy."</p>

<p>A peal of harsh, savage laughter rang through
the woods at this delicious humour, and startled
the horse so that it strained harder in the gallop.</p>

<p>Through the woods, the burnt clearing, across
the marsh where Bob had tracked so steadily, the
broncho passed in the mad race. It was rough
riding for the boy as he lay on his back&mdash;half
across the Indian's knee, with his head partly free
of the blanket; but he set his teeth, determined
to bear the ordeal without a whimper, that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
might be more ready for the later critical
moment.</p>

<p>Then something (he never knew what) startled
the horse. It sprang sideways from the path
right into the bush, where a heavy branch caught
Red Fox right in the forehead.</p>

<p>One cry the Indian gave. Next moment both
the riders were thrown violently to the ground,
while the broncho went off wildly and riderless.</p>

<p>The folds of the blanket considerably lessened
the shock of Alf's fall, and as soon as he had
collected his rudely scattered senses he did not
take long to emerge from his chrysalis-like state.</p>

<p>He sprang to his feet, prepared to be instantly
on the defensive.</p>

<p>To his surprise he was unaccosted, and on
turning he saw the Indian lying face downwards
upon the ground, while a red stream was making
a ghastly pool around his head.</p>

<p>Holden was by his enemy's side in an instant.
He knelt down and turned the man on his back.
The movement was answered by a groan, but
apparently the Dacotah was unconscious, for he
did not attempt to move, and his eyes were closed.</p>

<p>A spring was close at hand. Alf tore off the
scarf that he wore round his throat in bushman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
fashion, soaked it in the water, and mopped the
redman's brow. Still there was no sign of
returning senses, and the lad was now grievously
distressed at his enemy's disaster. He
would have been rejoiced to have vanquished
the man, had the adventure terminated in an
unavoidable encounter. But now that Red Fox
was in distress, all hard feelings and resentment
had left the lad's heart. He was all sympathy for
misfortune. That is the way of the truly brave.</p>

<p>Seeing that recovery was tardy, Alf tore the
scarf in two pieces. With one strip he bound
the ugly wound that gaped in the Indian's forehead;
with the other he resumed his attentions
by moistening his lips and temples.</p>

<p>And by and by the redman opened his eyes.
He looked up vacantly before him, not seeming
to understand what had taken place.</p>

<p>"That's good!" remarked Alf cheerfully.
"You feel better now, don't you?"</p>

<p>Red Fox looked straight into the boy's face,
but without appearing to recognise him. Then
he muttered a few words in Indian and closed his
eyes again.</p>

<p>For some time he lay with his head resting
against his nurse, while Alf's thoughts began to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
wander to his absent father and the chum whom
he had left in such strange fashion.</p>

<p>Then he looked down again, and saw that the
Indian was regarding him with eyes wide open&mdash;looking
at him in a peculiar wondering fashion, as
if he saw for the first time a being of some strange
creation.</p>

<p>Holden smiled encouragingly as he touched
the man's brow with the damp cloth.</p>

<p>"How does the head feel now?" he asked.
"Does the cut pain you much?"</p>

<p>Red Fox did not answer immediately, but continued
to stare at the lad with the same open-eyed
wonder.</p>

<p>"Pale-face kind," he said at length, in quiet
tones. "He touch Red Fox like wing of a dove.
Why is the white boy so good?"</p>

<p>"Nonsense," returned Alf. "It's nothing at
all. You don't think that Englishmen would
leave a fellow to bleed to death, do you?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;English boy good," said the redskin.
Then he added, with a sort of wistfulness: "But
Indian would leave pale-face&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Rot!" was the sharp interruption. "If I had
been hurt as you have been, you would do just the
same. Now lie quiet for a while. You'll feel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
better soon, and then you can go back to your
people."</p>

<p>The Indian shook his head slowly.</p>

<p>"Red Fox understand. Red Fox know
English tongue good. But&mdash;he no' go back to
people. He go&mdash;Manito&mdash;Happy Hunting-ground&mdash;soon."</p>

<p>Alf was silent. He had never been in the
presence of death, and never before in the
presence of the dying. The thought awed him.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;white papoose good," the redskin went
on falteringly. "He kind to hand&mdash;that would
have cut face for revenge. Ugh! Red Fox bad
Indian, but&mdash;he sorry&mdash;now. Can brave white
boy forgive poor Indian?"</p>

<p>"Of course," returned Alf huskily. "You did
not understand. English people speak words
that they do not mean to hurt. It is I who
should ask forgiveness for what I said about you.
I, too, am sorry."</p>

<p>"Then&mdash;white and red are&mdash;brothers. They
bury the hatchet and&mdash;my white brother will stay
with Red Fox while he go Happy Hunting-ground?"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," the boy assented readily. "I won't
leave you. Don't you be afraid of that."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span></p>

<p>"It is well, for Red Fox would speak before he
go. He would speak true words to the pale-face.
He spoke forked words like serpent tongue when
he say that white man sent Red Fox to bring
papooses to Indian camp. But he speak well
now when he say white men with Mighty Hand
now&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"<i>Safe?</i>" exclaimed Holden, as the information
came to him with sudden joy and sudden dread.</p>

<p>And the answer was at once a relief and double
anxiety.</p>

<p>"White men safe&mdash;now. But before another
sun they&mdash;they die&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Die?" was the exclamation of horror that
greeted this announcement.</p>

<p>"Yes," the Indian answered. "Dacotahs
foolish. They say white men spirits that brought
great trouble of water to Indian. They say that
serpent totem call them to Pleasant Valley, and
there they burn unless serpent appear to save
them from fire." Here the Indian seemed to
gather strength, for, without allowing the horrified
boy time for utterance, he slightly raised himself
and spoke with a flash of energy.</p>

<p>"But white boy brave&mdash;white boy good. He
kind to Red Fox who would have used cruel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
knife. But Red Fox no' papoose now. He
know that white boy too brave to suffer; Red
Fox too bad to live. And he would save the
pale-face man&mdash;</p>

<p>"Go, my brother&mdash;go to the village of the
Dacotahs and find Thunder-maker, the Medicine
Man. Tell him that Red Fox die sorry that he
made bad promise&mdash;that before he die he bid
Thunder-maker speak true to foolish Dacotahs,
and tell that white men no' spirits. Thunder-maker
know. Thunder-maker can save white
men, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The last word choked in the Indian's throat.
He gave a gasp, fell back into Alf's arms, while
his eyes looked up hungrily into the lad's face.</p>

<p>"Be brave!" whispered the boy. "Be brave,
Red Fox. Manito waits for you. I have forgiven
you; He has forgiven you. All will be well."</p>

<p>"Red Fox understand. He&mdash;happy&mdash;&mdash;" were
the last words that the poor misguided redman
spoke, as he died gazing lovingly in his young
friend's tear-clouded eyes.</p>

<p>And it was thus that Bob found his chum&mdash;tenderly
holding his red brother in his arms while
the great journey was taken to Manito's happy
land for the sorrowful.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>
<h3>HOT ON THE TRAIL</h3>

<p>It was a happy meeting for the two chums
after the exciting events that each had
experienced. But it was rather sad, all the same;
for even in their joy at finding how both had
come through their trials with but little damage,
they could not but regret the tragic end to poor
Red Fox.</p>

<p>"He was a high-tempered chap," said Arnold,
when he had listened to his friend's story. "All
the same, he must have had some good in him,
since he was so completely changed at the end."</p>

<p>"He seemed sorry enough," Alf rejoined.
"And I must say that I feel wretchedly sorry
about the whole thing. In a way it was my
fault&mdash;making the remarks that I did. It never
occurred to me that he would understand a
word&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"As apparently he did. However, it can't be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
helped now. No doubt he had some evil purpose
all along, or he wouldn't have come to us with
that lie about being sent by your father and
mine."</p>

<p>"At the same time it has taught me a lesson,"
said Alf. "I guess I'll keep my opinions to
myself next time, when they are so uncomplimentary."</p>

<p>"Just as well," Bob agreed seriously. Then,
turning to the dead Indian: "We've got to lay
that poor redskin to rest. I wonder how we are
to manage it!"</p>

<p>"We can't dig&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And we can't leave the body uncovered. The
wolves would work mischief in no time."</p>

<p>"How would it be if we were to lay him in
that little hollow and cover him with big stones?"
suggested Holden. "There are plenty of
boulders about, and we could easily cover him
with branches first, with stones on the top, to
keep off the animals."</p>

<p>"Right," Bob said; and together the lads
gently raised the Indian's body and placed it in
a little flower-scented hollow that, after all, was
a fitting bed to receive the royal dead&mdash;quite as
fitting as a dark pit. Then they cast maple<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
branches over it, and carried boulders until a
substantial mound was raised.</p>

<p>And when all was completed as well as they
were able to do it, instinctively both lads knelt
beside the grave and prayed for a few minutes
in silence. And the birds overhead sang their
hymns to unite in the service&mdash;happy songs of
gladness they sang, that seemed to convey to
the boys' hearts the grand lesson of all funeral
services&mdash;that death is not all sadness, for we
know of the joy that follows.</p>

<p>There was nothing more to be done now but
to return to camp. Mackintosh had probably
returned by this time, and he or Haggis would
be able to guide to the Dacotah village on the
urgent errand. So the broncho was caught. It
had never wandered far after the recovery from
its fright, which was probably due to the sudden
appearance of a wolf in the scrub; and before
long the chums were on the home trail, taking it
in turn to ride the horse.</p>

<p>Camp was reached about noon, and the boys
were greeted at the tent by the Scot.</p>

<p>"Where in the world have you two laddies
been?" he immediately questioned. "Here's
Haggis and me (to say no' a word about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
Bannock) returned at breakfast-time to find no' a
single body at the camp. No' that time has been
wasted, for we would have rested till dinner in
any case. But it's foolish tiring yoursels like this
when there's hard work before you. Pleasure is
all very well&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"We've been on no pleasure trip," interrupted
Alf, with a sad smile. "It has been anything but
pleasure to Arnold and me."</p>

<p>Thereupon Holden immediately launched into
the story of his adventure and his chum's&mdash;a tale
that was listened to with silent surprise both by
Mackintosh and the half-breed, who had come
out from the tent and stood attentively apart.</p>

<p>"Well, well," the Scotsman commented at the
close, "these are stirring times for you boys.
There's no' a bit o' doot aboot that." Then he
added seriously: "But I'm thinking we'll no' be
able to wait here ower long. We must set oot at
once. I ken something o' this Indian legend o'
water-spirits, and I ken something o' Indian ways
as well. There's evil things that will be doing
if we canna stop them."</p>

<p>"Did you find out anything while you were
away with Haggis?" questioned Bob.</p>

<p>"A bit. We found the tracks o' boots as well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
as moccasins, and we followed far enough to learn
that they had gone to the Dacotah village. Then
we came back to fetch you laddies. And I found
four grand specimens for my collection! Real
fine they are&mdash;such as will make my brither
entomologists in Edinburgh open their eyes as
big as Duddingston Loch when they see them.
But there&mdash;I must be daft to be thinkin' o' moths
at such a time. See, Haggis! Hurry on wi' the
denner! We'll be striking the camp, for we must
mak' straight for Pleasant Valley wi'oot delay."</p>

<p>The speaker was all bustle and hurry now,
and as the boys followed to render assistance,
Bob asked&mdash;</p>

<p>"Pleasant Valley? But did you not say that
they were at the Dacotah village?"</p>

<p>"Of course I did. But I said <i>were</i>, not <i>are</i>.
Did you no' attend to what your freend said&mdash;that
Red Fox told him that Mighty Hand would leave
for Pleasant Valley by another sun? That's the
day."</p>

<p>"Oh, I see. Then you mean to go there
direct?"</p>

<p>"Exactly. I ken something o' that Pleasant
Valley. There's no' a verra pleasant look aboot
it noo&mdash;a desert o' a place&mdash;all crags and sand,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
wi' just a pickle o' trees. It's a branch arm o' the
Athabasca, and has been a torrent at some flood-time&mdash;the
time that probably started the legend.
But there's no' been ony stream flowing there in
the recollection o' living man. But"&mdash;and the
naturalist was predominant for the instant&mdash;"there
are rare kinds o' hawk moth to be found in that
same desert! You'll be seeing the value o' my
phosphorus invention before another couple of
nights are out."</p>

<p>The boys laughed as the man's enthusiasm
came suddenly uppermost, to the exclusion of (to
their minds) a subject of more vital importance.</p>

<p>"I do believe, Skipper, that you would sooner
capture a rare beetle than be a Napoleon!"
laughed Bob, to which the naturalist replied with
scorn, as he indicated the lads to take the opposite
end of the tent to roll&mdash;</p>

<p>"Beetle? What do you take me for&mdash;a
coleopterist? Ma conscience, laddie, these insects
are no interest to me. I wouldn't touch
one with a pair o' tongs. It's moths and butterflies
for Skipper Mackintosh&mdash;the dainty fluttering
things that are like bits o' sunshine and
beams o' the moonlight. Beetle? Speak not to
me the name o' thae things o' darkness!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span></p>

<p>The tent was rolled and most of the other
adjuncts to the camp were collected and deftly
stowed on the back of the pack-horse with the neatness
of expert campers. Then a hasty cold meal
was taken while Mackintosh delivered his plans.</p>

<p>"Now, boys, listen to me. I've got to be your
captain in this journey, for you'll admit that I
know best. Well, I've prepared food enough for
three of us for two days. Each will carry his
own. Then you've got a pair o' guns and a rifle
between you. That's all that you'll need. I've
got my own rifle and a revolver, in case o' accidents,
though I'm hoping there'll be no need for the like
o' that. Now we'll start off at once. There's no
straight road from here for Pleasant Valley, but
it's through bog and bush where the horse canna
get wi' its burden. But it'll make four or five
hours' difference to us other than by the round-about
way. So Haggis'll take the pack-horse.
Ay, he'll be better o' Bannock, too. Dogs are
often useless creatures in an expedition that
might mean creeping and hiding. Bannock's no'
that bad-mannered; but he loves hunting, and a
wolf might tempt him."</p>

<p>"How far is it to this Pleasant Valley, as it is
called?" asked Holden.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span></p>

<p>"Aboot fifteen mile as we will travel, twenty at
the least by the path Haggis'll follow. Oh, ay,
Haggis'll be all right. There's no fear o' him
not turning up aboot midnight. He's no' quite
ceevilised yet, for he canna mind a' the words o'
'Auld Lang Syne' and 'Rule Britannia.' But
he's ceevilised enough to be dependable. You
wait at the Old Crossing till we turn up,
Haggis!"</p>

<p>"Right, boss," answered the half-breed, who
seldom spoke more than two words at a time
if he could avoid doing so, and he immediately
rose up to make the final arrangements for his
departure.</p>

<p>"Then there's no more to be said," the
Scotsman concluded. "It's start right away;
keep a brave heart and a steady foot foremost,
and we'll no' be that far from our friends come
nightfall."</p>

<p>Skipper Mackintosh had spoken nothing but
the truth when he said that the direct trail was
not one that a laden pack-horse could travel
with ease, far less speed.</p>

<p>The earlier portion of the march was easy
enough. But after about an hour's walking
through the bush the travellers reached a mile<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
of bogland, across which a path could only be
found by stepping cautiously from one grassy
hummock to another. Even then the surface of
the moss shivered for yards around, and the mud
between the tufts oozed, as if its mouth were
watering to swallow up the trio.</p>

<p>"Feel for every step before you put your
weight on it!" the naturalist instructed. He, of
course, had taken the foremost position of leader.
"If you want to disappear quicker than you
did in yon muskeg, Master Bob, you can set the
tip o' your big toe in yon mud, and you'll travel as
quick as electricity."</p>

<p>This part of the journey was certainly fatiguing,
but the travellers kept up good hearts by pleasant
banter and dogged determination.</p>

<p>Reaching solid ground again, there was
another easier spell of bush tramping. Then
the trail began the ascent of a hill&mdash;a rocky, loose-bouldered
slope that could only be traversed by a
narrow path that somewhat resembled a strip of
ribbon on the side of a house.</p>

<p>Up they went, higher and higher each step,
with the sharp slope to the left and a sheer
declivity of loose stones at the right.</p>

<p>Once Alf slipped, and the stone against which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
he tripped went leaping down the slope without
stopping, until it was lost to sight some three
hundred feet or more below.</p>

<p>"Which of you two laddies is the one
that's danced down the hillside?" questioned
Mackintosh, without seeming to look round. His
voice was pleasant, but he had taken a quick
glance backwards all the same, and his face had
paled a little. That was but his kindly way of
cheering the boys and helping them to keep their
nerves in hand.</p>

<p>After a time the climbing ceased. It was now
a level path, though it was none the less ready
to trap the unwary, as it twisted round spurs
and crossed little ravines. Then suddenly the
travellers became aware of a sound like that of
a small cataract.</p>

<p>Mackintosh stopped, and as they listened they
were able to tell that the sound was one that proceeded
from the continuous rolling of innumerable
stones that were being propelled down the hillside
at no great distance.</p>

<p>"What on earth is it?" questioned Alf, and
at the same moment the man pointed towards
a cloud of dust that had rounded a spur ahead
of them&mdash;a cloud that was advancing rapidly in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
their direction to the accompaniment of loud
bleating.</p>

<p>"A herd of mountain sheep on the stampede,"
was the Skipper's immediate verdict.</p>

<p>"Sheep? Coming towards us?" exclaimed
Bob, and as the words were spoken there could
be seen amid the dust a lot of woolly animals
tearing frantically along the narrow path, throwing
the stones from beneath their feet, while now and
then one would stumble and roll down the slope
as though it had been shot from a cannon.</p>

<p>The noise was bewildering as it echoed among
the barren hills and rocks.</p>

<p>"See! There's a black animal chasing them!"
exclaimed Holden excitedly.</p>

<p>"A bear," said Mackintosh with grim calmness,
as he rapidly slung his repeating rifle into
readiness, an example that the boys quickly
followed.</p>

<p>"What's to be done?" Bob questioned.
Frankly he had not the remotest notion how to
meet such an emergency, for it was impossible
to climb upwards, as it was equally impossible to
descend, while to retire along the path would only
be to postpone the threatening disaster for a few
minutes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span></p>

<p>"Come! Follow me quickly; but be careful,"
Mackintosh suddenly ordered, he himself
hastening forward as the boys followed.</p>

<p>At this position the side of the hill bent to the
left in the form of a horseshoe, so that it was
quite easy from where the three adventurers
stood to throw a stone across the intervening
chasm to the path at the other side.</p>

<p>Mackintosh led the way until he had reached
the first spur; then he told the boys to wait.</p>

<p>"Keep your hands steady and your guns ready,
boys," he said. "I'm going along a bit to shoot
down the leaders, if it may be; you empty your
rifle and a round or two o' shot into yon bear.
They'll all be opposite us on the other side in
a few minutes. A steady nerve will do it; so, if
ever you were cool in your born days, this is the
day to be coolest."</p>

<p>Without waiting for further remark from either
side, the man then hastened some yards along the
path and took up a position where he could kneel
and steady his gun arm on a boulder, and hardly
had the several positions been taken up when
with roar and clatter and cloud the stampede
rounded the opposite hill-spur.</p>

<p>Crack! went the Scotsman's repeater. Crack!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
crack! And down tumbled three sheep, two
of which rolled over the slope, leaving one to
bar the way in the path. The others took the
downward plunge. Crack! crack! crack! The
rifle spoke rapidly and surely, as each bullet found
a billet in a different animal.</p>

<p>The race was checked, but not yet effectually,
though the Skipper had now more time to pick
off the leaders as they scrambled over their
brethren&mdash;only to fall victims to the sharp-shooter
and help to build up a barrier to impede the
others.</p>

<p>It was now a terrible sight of animals in
desperation.</p>

<p>There were a hundred mountain sheep at least,
and they were scrambling in a dense mass, trying
vainly to advance&mdash;fighting, struggling, tumbling
down the slope in mad confusion. Now and then
one would have a momentary success and almost
cross the barrier; then the deadly rifle would
again send its message&mdash;and the barrier would be
raised by one victim more.</p>

<p>Meantime, faithful to their charge, the boys
kept their attention to the rear of the herd, but the
dust was so dense that they could barely discern
the hindmost animals.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span></p>

<p>Then Bob suddenly exclaimed&mdash;</p>

<p>"Look out!"</p>

<p>But Alf had been equally ready. A rifle and
a gun darted up to each boy's shoulder at the
same instant; a simultaneous explosion came like
one from both weapons. Then followed a roar
like a miniature thunder-peal, and a brown grizzly
was seen to shoot down the declivity in pursuit of
the poor sheep that he had driven to destruction
in such numbers.</p>

<p>"Bravo!" shouted Mackintosh, letting go his
feelings in a wild whoop of exultation. "A grand
shot, lads!"</p>

<p>"I guess his day's work is done," returned
Alf quietly, though he was none the less delighted
with his own and his chum's success.</p>

<p>Finding that the fierce pursuit had ceased, the
few remaining sheep turned on the retreat, since
they found it impossible to advance farther.
Then the adventurers proceeded on their way,
though they, in their turn, found it impossible to
pass the barrier, and some time had to be expended
in carefully tumbling the carcases down the slope.
But soon the work was successfully accomplished,
and the path once more clear to permit the three
comrades to pursue their urgent course.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>
<h3>THUNDER-MAKER'S DOWNFALL</h3>

<p>During the rest of the journey through the
hills and along Trapper's Pass, no further
accidents occurred to hinder progress, and once
free of the hills the trail was level and across a
stretch of prairie.</p>

<p>Towards night the Pleasant Valley was reached,
and the three travellers descended to the part of
the river known to trappers as the Old Crossing,
though it was a ford where no water flowed.</p>

<p>On reaching this camp-ground there were evidences
of the recent presence of strangers. Moreover,
these strangers were not travelling in any
secret way, since they had taken no pains to
conceal their tracks, and the ashes of trampled-out
fires were still warm.</p>

<p>Mackintosh carefully examined the surroundings,
and came to the decision, from certain signs,
that it had been an Indian camp.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span></p>

<p>"To my mind the best thing for us to do is to
rest here for an hour or two," the man said.</p>

<p>"I shan't be sorry," said Bob. "We pressed
on rather rapidly, and, to tell you the truth, I'm
rather fagged."</p>

<p>"But what of the others&mdash;your father and
mine?" questioned Alf. "They may need
help&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Not yet," Mackintosh interrupted. "It's no'
possible for them to reach Flood Creek before
morning, and the&mdash;the ceremony must take place
at moonlight. Oh yes, I ken fine how you are
both feeling. You're wanting to be off until you
break down with weariness. But that's no' the
way to do things in the backwoods. Work until
you are out-and-out weary, then rest, and you'll
be able to work again. But to keep on slaving
till you're worked out&mdash;that's nothing but a gowk's
game, and can bring no good."</p>

<p>"I suppose you are right," said Holden
slowly.</p>

<p>"Of course I am. Don't you fear, laddie. I'll
no' be too late. I know the ways o' the Indian,
and I know the Dacotahs. Depend upon it,
your faithers are being kindly treated, as best the
redskins know how to treat friends. The Dacotahs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
are firm in their superstition, but they're kindly
folk all the same."</p>

<p>So the boys resigned themselves to the ruling
of their guide, though it was irksome to be idle
when each was longing to be up and doing. And
now that they were so near to the achievement
of their quest, it was even more galling to be
inactive than it had been when there was distance
as an excuse.</p>

<p>It was a dreary place. The valley was deep,
and there was a river-bed where once&mdash;before
the memory of living man&mdash;water had flowed
in a swift and wide flood, but where now there
was nothing but dust. Not a tree was within
sight. There was hardly any grass. Only a few
cacti appeared to thrive on the barren soil. The
rest was rocks, sand, and bordering precipices.</p>

<p>The boys shuddered as they looked around.</p>

<p>"It's a terrible spot," Bob commented, as he
viewed the dreary scene. "It feels like being in
prison."</p>

<p>"There's a well with the finest of cool water
about six feet away," was Mackintosh's remark.
It was his quiet way of forcing home the truth
that there is a bright speck in everything, if we
only take the trouble to look for it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span></p>

<p>A meal was made from the supplies with
which each had been provided, and an hour
or two later Haggis turned up with the pack-horse.</p>

<p>It was not considered necessary to pitch the
tent that night, as a very early start was proposed
to be taken at the streak of dawn. So each lay
down as he was, with a sand-heap for a pillow,
and soon the little camp was fast asleep. They
needed no rocking. Sleep came almost with the
closing of eyes.</p>

<p>As morning broke, Mackintosh was the first
to waken. He quickly roused the others, and a
swift "eve-of-battle" meal was served out. The
business being ended, the pack-horse was once
more loaded, and the journey resumed toward
Flood Creek, which was now only about five
miles distant.</p>

<p>The Dacotah camp was sighted some way off,
and it may be imagined how excited the lads felt
when they found themselves practically at the end
of their journey.</p>

<p>But once there, what would be the result?</p>

<p>That was the question that was exercising the
minds of both; and when Bob gave it voice, the
Scotsman smiled grimly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span></p>

<p>"What'll happen? Well, no one can foresee
the future, but I can imagine it."</p>

<p>"And what do you imagine?" asked Bob.</p>

<p>"That there will be a pickle o' bother before
all comes out right. Superstition is no' that easy
baulked; but if we ever have to fight for it, don't
think that the ancient Highland blood of the
Mackintosh is water in the veins of the clan."</p>

<p>"I hope it won't come to that," remarked Alf
quietly, and the Highlander rejoined&mdash;</p>

<p>"That's my hope too. But there's no telling.
We've <i>got</i> to conquer&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And conquer we shall!" added Bob, with
determination.</p>

<p>On reaching the camp, the rescuers were met
by a host of Indians, who were all filled with
curiosity regarding the strangers. The white
men looked around them, but no signs could they
see of the captives.</p>

<p>Then Mackintosh recognised a friend in Swift
Arrow.</p>

<p>"Ha, Nitchie!" he exclaimed, holding out his
hand for the Indian to grasp.</p>

<p>"It is pleasant for the eyes of Swift Arrow to
see the Black Bear in the camp of the Dacotahs,"
said the redskin as he returned the greeting.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span></p>

<p>"And it's good for him to look upon the face o
a friend," said the Scotsman. "I wish to speak
with Mighty Hand. Where is he?"</p>

<p>"The chief of the Dacotahs is here," replied a
voice from the crowd, and the great man himself
stepped forward.</p>

<p>"H'm. That's good. Saves a deal of seeking
when folk come of themselves." Then the speaker
launched straight into the subject of their quest.</p>

<p>"Now then, Mighty Hand, you and me are old
friends, and we can talk freely. You're wondering
the noo what has brought us here, and you
may ken without palaver. We have come for
your captives."</p>

<p>"Captives?" The chief looked puzzled as he
repeated the word.</p>

<p>"Ay, captives," emphasised Mackintosh.
"Perhaps you don't know the meaning of the
word."</p>

<p>"Mighty Hand knows the language of the pale-face.
But there are no captives in the Dacotah
camp."</p>

<p>At this the boys felt their hearts sink. Could
it be that, after all, Mackintosh had been mistaken,
or that Red Fox had deluded them? Could it
be that they had come too late?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span></p>

<p>But Mackintosh did not share these doubts.
He understood the working of the native mind
too well.</p>

<p>"That is good," he resumed. "If the Dacotahs
have no captives, then the white men are
free. They will travel back with me to their
camp now!"</p>

<p>Instantly a stern change came over the face
of the chief, and such of the other Indians as
understood English began to murmur with ominous
disapproval.</p>

<p>"My white brother speak not wise words,"
said Mighty Hand firmly. "The fiery totem call
that water-spirits suffer. What the totem call
must be answered. Only great medicine can bid
the fire sleep now."</p>

<p>"Idiots! Fools!" exclaimed Mackintosh, for
once allowing his irritation to betray him. "Do
you think that we are going to allow our own
people to suffer at the service of a lie? I tell you
that we will take those white men from your
hands whether you wish it or not!"</p>

<p>The Indian was unmoved by the Scotsman's
outburst.</p>

<p>"My white brother speak hot words. It
saddens heart of Mighty Hand to see anger in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
face of his brother. But he is wrong. The call
of the totem shall be answered when the moon
is round&mdash;to-night."</p>

<p>How this strain of argument might have progressed
it is hard to say, but it was cut short by
a cry like that of a wild beast, as Thunder-maker
sprang through the crowd, dressed in all the
hideous regalia of his profession.</p>

<p>"Dogs!" he cried furiously. "Do the pale-faces
come to insult the great chief of Dacotahs
and say that the fiery totem lie? Ugh! Spit upon
them, Mighty Hand! Chase these dogs from the
camp!"</p>

<p>Mackintosh had resumed his temper by now,
and he turned to greet the newcomer with a look
of feigned amusement.</p>

<p>"Who's this?" he asked pleasantly. "Is it a
monkey that Mighty Hand has caught to please
him, or is it maybe a little dancing-bear tricked
out in feathers for the braves and warriors to
laugh at?"</p>

<p>Thunder-maker well understood the jibe, and
he flung himself about with passion.</p>

<p>"Ma conscience! Don't go making all that
noise," was the quiet reproof. "And if you'll
take my advice, you'll go home and put on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
warmer clothes. You've little enough on to keep
you cosy when the wind blows chill."</p>

<p>Poor Thunder-maker! He had never been
treated with such scant respect. Even the young
papooses were putting "tongue in cheek" towards
him, and some of the women could be seen
pointing their fingers at his discomfited self.</p>

<p>Blind with passion the Indian threw himself
upon the Scotsman. Instantly the boys had their
guns ready to protect their friend. But the next
moment they could not have pulled a trigger if it
had been necessary to save their lives thereby,
for they and the whole concourse of Indians were
shaking themselves with laughter at what was
taking place.</p>

<p>What was it?</p>

<p>Well, merely that Thunder-maker had not
reckoned with the enormous strength that was
latent in the Scotsman, nor the peculiar sense of his
humour; for, no sooner had the Indian charged,
than he found himself gripped by powerful hands,
turned face downwards on a bent knee, and
smacked in good old homely style of punishment,
which the medicine man's scanty attire rendered
exceedingly suitable.</p>

<p>Thunder-maker yelled and kicked, but he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
held as if in a vice, while the slaps rang out
in rapid succession and the valley echoed with
laughter.</p>

<p>At last Mackintosh released the delinquent,
and the poor man slunk away amid jeers and
laughter. His day was over, and from that hour
our white friends saw him no more.</p>

<p>When the hum had subsided, Mackintosh once
more appealed to the chief, but without success.</p>

<p>"We must obey the totem," was reiterated
doggedly, though it was plain that the chief was
sorry to be at enmity with the strangers.</p>

<p>"But how do you know that you are obeying
the totem?" questioned Bob, who could remain
silent no longer.</p>

<p>At this question Mighty Hand turned to the
boy with an indulgent smile.</p>

<p>"White spirits come from waters that are silver
when moon round. By this we know. But if
redmen foolish, totem wise. Totem will not let
redmen do wrong. Totem will appear serpent of
fire to warn redmen no' light flames."</p>

<p>"We can do nothing more at present," said
Mackintosh, as he turned to the lads. "We'll pitch
our camp over yonder and talk things over."</p>

<p>After the camp was pitched and food partaken,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
Mackintosh decided to pay a visit to Swift Arrow,
to see if he could not manage to argue that old
man into a state of reason, so as to support another
appeal to Mighty Hand. It had not been considered
advisable to press for an interview with the captives,
lest they might be too closely watched, and
any future attempt at rescue be thus frustrated.</p>

<p>"I'll just go by mysel'," the man explained.
"Swift Arrow is an old friend o' mine, and no'
a bad creature in many ways. Haggis is away
cracking with some o' his friends also. You'll not
mind being left alone for a time? I'll no' be long."</p>

<p>"We don't mind," said Bob. "Anything to
see light in this difficulty. We'll be all right."</p>

<p>"Very well. I'll be back as soon as I can,
and I'll hope to have good news for you."</p>

<p>Left to themselves, the lads did not speak
much, for their hearts were very heavy, knowing
that if some plan of rescue was not thought of
within a few hours it would be too late.</p>

<p>For a considerable time they were absolutely
silent, lying within the tent, surrounded by stores
and the various tins and boxes of the naturalist's
outfit.</p>

<p>Then Bob's mind began to wander over all
the events that led up to the present day, and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
in wondering at the blind ignorance that could
yield so much to a mere legend, he recalled the
chiefs last words&mdash;</p>

<p>"'The totem will not let the redmen do
wrong,'" he quoted mentally. "Fools! As if
a serpent could tell them to do anything in the
first place! How can any reasoning person be
so&mdash;&mdash; Alf!"</p>

<p>Bob had suddenly sprung to his feet as he
uttered the exclamation, and Holden started to
look at his friend, as if he had suddenly lost his
senses.</p>

<p>"Why, what's the matter, old man?" he exclaimed.
"Have you been asleep?"</p>

<p>"Asleep? No! Never was wider awake in
all my life. Why, I've got it. They are saved!
They are saved!" And the boy laughed for very
joy at the thought.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" questioned Holden
anxiously. It was little wonder that he believed
for the moment that anxiety had brought his
chum to a fever.</p>

<p>"Mean?" the elder boy echoed. "Simply
this&mdash;that our fathers shall be saved, and you
and I will do it. It's all so simple. We must
have been fools not to think of it before!"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX</h2>
<h3>THE FIERY TOTEM</h3>

<p>The two men&mdash;Arnold and Holden&mdash;were
sitting alone in the teepee that had been
assigned for their use. Neither was speaking,
for the day was drawing to a close, and they
were almost hopeless of seeing any avenue of
escape from the fate that the Indian superstition
had ordained for them.</p>

<p>We said "almost hopeless." Of course it
was necessary to make that proviso, for no one
is ever hopeless in extremity, so long as he retains
faith in Providence. But every scheme that they
had planned had been proved void on consideration.
Though free to a certain extent, they were
well watched. Escape was impossible, and their
only remaining hope was that when they were
led forth for the sacrifice they might be able to
take advantage of some opportunity to make a
last stand for freedom.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span></p>

<p>"It would not matter so much for ourselves,
if it were not for the boys," Arnold said at last.
"Their position is too terrible."</p>

<p>"Of course they will be able to find their
way back to Edmonton, when they see that
there is no hope of our returning&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"<i>No</i> hope?" repeated Arnold. "Don't say
that. I don't want to give up hope until the
very last moment. Something <i>may</i> turn up, and
in any case I intend to make a good fight for
freedom."</p>

<p>"I suppose I do, too, when I think about it,"
returned Holden, with a short forced laugh.
"We both mean to kick up a bit of a dust
when the exciting moment comes&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And you may bet it will be exciting for the
first redskin who comes against my fist. I
promised myself to have a go at that skunk
Thunder-maker, before I make my bow to the
world. But for him, I believe this trouble would
never have gone so far."</p>

<p>"He certainly did his best to pile it on,"
agreed the younger man. "I imagine that he
was rather in hot water this morning, for I
thought I heard him yelling. There's no mistaking
that harsh voice of his. And there were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
sounds, too, for all the world as if some person
were getting a jolly good spanking. You were
dozing at the time, so I didn't disturb you. But
I know I nearly waked you with laughing at
the thought of Thunder-maker receiving a good
old-fashioned correction."</p>

<p>"It would take more than that to do him
good," said Arnold, with a frown. "The man
is a cheat and a scoundrel of the worst sort.
He showed us what he was worth when he
told us, two nights ago, that he had the tribe
by the nose. Even now, after telling us that
he knew better, I suppose he's working up the
people for to-night's show."</p>

<p>Holden grunted contemptuously.</p>

<p>"He seems bad to the core. In my opinion
it has been he who has kept Mighty Hand
away. The chief was ready to reason, but I
expect Thunder-maker's boast that he could
lead the tribe was a true one."</p>

<p>"The old case of kings being ruled by their
subjects," commented Arnold.</p>

<p>After this conversation again flagged. Having
little to say of an encouraging nature, the men
deemed that silence was best, and each sat
engrossed with his own thoughts while the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
daylight waned and the shadows began to creep
over the valley that a joking fate had called
"Pleasant."</p>

<p>As time went on the Englishmen seemed to
become aware of a sort of disturbance in the
camp. Feet were hurrying here and there, and
voices were speaking rapidly in low tones. Now
and then, as some one passed the teepee, the
words "fiery totem" could be heard by those
within, so naturally the Englishmen attributed
the excitement to matters relating to the approaching
sacrifice.</p>

<p>But presently the excitement seemed to grow
more intense, and the voices were raised to a
higher pitch.</p>

<p>Unable to restrain curiosity any longer, the
men went to look out from the door of the teepee,
and as they reached the opening a strange sight
presented itself before them.</p>

<p>Gathered in many groups were all the Indians
of the tribe, including all the squaws and papooses,
while the tall figure of Mighty Hand could
be seen through the gloaming, standing erect
upon a hillock at a little distance to one side.</p>

<p>All had their backs turned towards the
Englishmen.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span></p>

<p>They were facing the towering blackness of a
mighty cliff, while with a sudden wave of silence
they stood doubly transfixed, with eyes directed
to one portion of the dark wall, where a sort of
light was dimly glimmering.</p>

<p>What could it be that had such a power to
fascinate the whole tribe?</p>

<p>The Englishmen looked in the same direction,
but the object seemed to be nothing more than
an irregular line of light that might have been
some reflection caused by the setting sun.</p>

<p>Still all watched in silence.</p>

<p>And, as the darkness deepened so did the light
become clear. From an irregular line about ten
feet long it seemed to take form gradually, while
it undoubtedly intensified in brightness. Clearer
and still more plainly was the outline revealed,
until at last&mdash;when the sun had quite vanished&mdash;there
stood out against the black wall the shape
of a snake of fire, poised in the very act to strike,
just as it was outlined on the breast of Mighty
Hand!</p>

<p>Arnold and Holden were astounded at what
they surmised to be some fresh trick on the part
of Thunder-maker, or some special form of the
impending ceremony. And at the same moment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
a loud cry broke from the throats of the watching
multitude.</p>

<p>"The fiery totem! The fiery totem!"</p>

<p>Then the Indians fell face downwards to the
ground with fear.</p>

<p>Surely such a prodigy had never been seen
before?</p>

<p>The sacred totem of the tribe had itself appeared,
to warn the Dacotahs that the fire was
not to burn that night; that the two prisoners
were men, not evil spirits.</p>

<p>While the two men were standing watching
the prostrate Indians, three figures crept round
an adjacent tent&mdash;two of whom then darted forward,
while the third followed at more dignified
leisure.</p>

<p>"Bob!"</p>

<p>"Alf!"</p>

<p>These were the exclamations that burst from
the lips of the captives as two boys launched
themselves forward to receiving arms. Then
came the dignified Skipper Mackintosh.</p>

<p>"You are saved, good sirs," he said, without
waiting for an introduction. "My good phosphorus
paint and the brains o' these fine laddies has
called up the fiery totem. I'm thinking that there
will be no sacrifice to superstition the&mdash;night,
and that you'll a' be on your way back to Crane
Creek the morn."</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>And when next day the time came for departure,
and the fathers and sons had made their
arrangements with the good wishes and help of
Mighty Hand, Swift Arrow, and a host of eager
redmen, it was Bob who was first to notice that
Skipper Mackintosh and the half-breed seemed
in no haste to accompany the party.</p>

<p>"Are you not coming with us?" the boy asked.</p>

<p>The Scot smiled and shook his head.</p>

<p>"No. I'm thinking to bide here for a few
days, to hunt for yon hawk moth that I told you
aboot. Besides, when you're safe out of the
way, I mean to have a serious talk with Mighty
Hand and his folk. I wouldn't have them think
that yon was a real fiery serpent. That would
be idolatry. We had to cheat them to save life,
but&mdash;well, I'll no' leave the Dacotahs until I've
ceevilised them into believin' that the legend of the
fiery totem is false, and that there's better ways
o' living than by believin' such gowk's nonsense."</p>
